	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Elia Kazan</b> (<small>IPA:Â </small><span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IPA_for_Greek" title="Wikipedia:IPA for Greek">[eËˆlia kaËˆzan]</a></span>; September 7, 1909 â€“ September 28, 2003) was a Greek-American director, described as "one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history". He also produced, and wrote screenplays and novels. Born in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks" title="Greeks">Greek</a> parents, they emigrated to New York when he was four. After two years studying acting at Yale, he acted professionally for eight years before becoming a stage and film director. Kazan co-founded the influential <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Theatre_(New_York)" title="Group Theatre (New York)">Group Theater</a> in 1932 and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors_Studio" title="Actors Studio">Actors Studio</a> in 1947, and together with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="Lee Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a>, introduced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">Method acting</a> to the American stage and cinema as a new form of self-expression and psychological "realism". Having been an actor himself for eight years, he brought sensitivity and understanding of the acting process, and was later considered the ideal "actor's director".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan introduced a new generation of unknown young actors to the movie audiences, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>, but was most noted for drawing out the best dramatic performances from his actors. As a result, he directed 21 different actors to Oscar nominations, resulting in nine wins. He became "one of the consummate filmmakers of the 20th century", after directing a continual string of successful films, including, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_Eden_(film)" title="East of Eden (film)">East of Eden</a></i>. During his career, he won two Oscars as Best Director and received an Honorary Oscar, won three Tony Awards, and four Golden Globes. Among the other new actors he introduced to movie audiences for the first time, were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Harris" title="Julie Harris">Julie Harris</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffith" title="Andy Griffith">Andy Griffith</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Remick" title="Lee Remick">Lee Remick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Torn" title="Rip Torn">Rip Torn</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Marie_Saint" title="Eva Marie Saint">Eva Marie Saint</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Balsam" title="Martin Balsam">Martin Balsam</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Gwynne" title="Fred Gwynne">Fred Gwynne</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Hingle" title="Pat Hingle">Pat Hingle</a>. He also elicited some of the best performances in the careers of actors like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dunn_(actor)" title="James Dunn (actor)">James Dunn</a>. Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens,_Jr." title="George Stevens, Jr.">George Stevens, Jr.</a> concludes that Kazan's films and new actors have "changed American moviemaking".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of his films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, "I don't move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme. In some way the channel of the film should also be in my own life." His first such "issue" film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman%27s_Agreement" title="Gentleman's Agreement">Gentleman's Agreement</a></i> (1947), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>, which dealt with hidden anti-Semitism in America. It received 8 Oscar nominations and 3 wins, and Kazan's first for Best Director. It was followed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_(1949_film)" title="Pinky (1949 film)">Pinky</a></i>, one of the first films to address racial prejudice against blacks. In 1954, he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>, a film about union corruption in New York, which some consider "one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema." A major film earlier in his career was <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed. It received 12 Oscar nominations, winning 4, and was Marlon Brando's breakthrough role, although his screen debut was the previous year, 1950, playing a paraplegic war veteran in 'The Men'. In 1955, he directed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck" title="John Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>'s <i>East of Eden</i>, which also introduced James Dean to movie audiences for the first time, making him an overnight star.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A turning point in Kazan's career came with his testimony as a "friendly witness" before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Committee on Un-American Activities</a> in 1952, which cost him the respect of many liberal friends and colleagues, such as playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>. Kazan later explains that he took "only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong". Overall, Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s by his run of provocative, issues-driven subjects, and acting. Moreover, his personal brand of cinema, employing real locations over sets, unknowns over stars, and realism over convenient genres, proved influential to a whole generation of independent filmmakers in the 1960s, such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Lumet" title="Sidney Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes" title="John Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Penn" title="Arthur Penn">Arthur Penn</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. Film author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Freer" title="Ian Freer">Ian Freer</a> concludes that "If his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood â€” and actors everywhere â€” owes him, is enormous." In 2010, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> co-directed the documentary film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Letter_to_Elia" title="A Letter to Elia">A Letter to Elia</a></i>, as a personal tribute to Kazan, who he credits as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elia Kazan was born in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phanar" title="Phanar">Phanar</a>, the traditional Greek quarter of what is now Istanbul, Turkey to a family of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_people" title="Greek people">Greek</a> descent originally from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatolia" title="Anatolia">Anatolia</a>. His parents, George and Athena Kazanjoglou, (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9e" title="NÃ©e">nÃ©e</a> Shishmanoglou,) emigrated to the United States when he was four years old. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elia Kazanjoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. He had a brother, Avraam Kazan, who was born in Berlin, and later became a psychiatrist.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates described him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, <i>America America</i>, which he made into a film in 1963. In it, he describes his family as "alienated" from both their parents' <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox" title="Greek Orthodox">Greek Orthodox</a> values and from those of mainstream America. His mother's family were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton" title="Cotton">cotton</a> merchants who imported cotton from England, and sold it wholesale. His father became a rug merchant after emigrating to the United States, and expected that his son would go into the family business.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After attending public schools in New York, he enrolled at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williams_College" title="Williams College">Williams College</a> in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes, although he still graduated cum laude. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities, but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname "Gadg," for gadget, because, he said, "I was small, compact, and handy to have around."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan discusses his family's Turkish and staunchly Greek ethnic/cultural background with film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Ciment" title="Michel Ciment">Michel Ciment</a>:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his book and later film by the same title, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America_America" title="America America">America America</a>, he tells how, and why, his family left Turkey and moved to America. Kazan notes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that "it's all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantinople" title="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances... It's also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan notes some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film. He writes, "I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas." To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan's uncle Avraam, kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before undertaking the film, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family's background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a "deeper question: 'Why America? What were you hoping for?'" His mother gave him the answer, however: "A.E. brought us here." Kazan states that "A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehowâ€”this was the wonderâ€”he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.<i></i></p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan writes of the movie, "It's my favorite of all the films I've made; the first film that was entirely mine."</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Stage_career">Stage career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1932, after spending two years at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yale_University_School_of_Drama&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Yale University School of Drama (page does not exist)">Yale University School of Drama</a>, he moved to New York to become a professional stage actor. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing â€œsocial commentaryâ€&#157;. Together, they formed the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Theatre_(New_York)" title="Group Theatre (New York)">Group Theater</a>, which showcased many lesser known plays of with deep social or political messages. With them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the "family of the Group Theater, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time," writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Kazan's autobiography, Kazan writes of the "lasting impact on him of the Group," noting in particular, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="Lee Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Clurman" title="Harold Clurman">Harold Clurman</a> as "father figures", along with his close friendship with playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Odets" title="Clifford Odets">Clifford Odets</a>. Kazan, during an interview with Michel Ciment, describes the Group:</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan's first national success came as New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Groupâ€™s most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Odets" title="Clifford Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, <i>Waiting for Lefty</i>, and his performance was called "dynamic," leading some to describe him as the "proletarian thunderbolt."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the themes that would run through all of his work were "personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice", writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his "strong commitment to the social and social psychological - rather than the purely political - implications of drama".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, he began directing a number of the Group Theater's plays. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_prize" title="Pulitzer prize">Pulitzer prize</a>-winning play by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Wilder" title="Thornton Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a>, <i>The Skin of Our Teeth</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead" title="Tallulah Bankhead">Tallulah Bankhead</a>. He then went on to direct stage productions of <i>All My Sons</i> and <i>Death of a Salesman,</i> both written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, and then directed <i>Streetcar Named Desire</i>, written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Group Theater's summer rehearsal headquarters was at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Brook_Country_Club" title="Pine Brook Country Club">Pine Brook Country Club</a>, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Morgan" title="Harry Morgan">Harry Morgan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield" title="John Garfield">John Garfield</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luise_Rainer" title="Luise Rainer">Luise Rainer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Farmer" title="Frances Farmer">Frances Farmer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Geer" title="Will Geer">Will Geer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Da_Silva" title="Howard Da Silva">Howard Da Silva</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Odets" title="Clifford Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Cobb" title="Lee J. Cobb">Lee J. Cobb</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irwin_Shaw" title="Irwin Shaw">Irwin Shaw</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1947, he founded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%27s_Studio" title="Actor's Studio">Actor's Studio</a>, a non-profit workshop, with actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewis_(actor)" title="Robert Lewis (actor)">Robert Lewis</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Crawford" title="Cheryl Crawford">Cheryl Crawford</a>. It soon became famous for promoting "Method," a style of theater and acting involving "total immersion of actor into character," writes film author Ian Freer. According to Rapf, "the Studio rode the bandwagon of method fashionability, and Kazan was its clear star and attraction." Within a short time, as word spread, "everyone wanted to be at the Studio - not least because of the chance of being in a Kazan production in one medium or another."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among its first students were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Harris" title="Julie Harris">Julie Harris</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malden" title="Karl Malden">Karl Malden</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Neal" title="Patricia Neal">Patricia Neal</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Dunnock" title="Mildred Dunnock">Mildred Dunnock</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whitmore" title="James Whitmore">James Whitmore</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_Stapleton" title="Maureen Stapleton">Maureen Stapleton</a>. In 1951, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="Lee Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a> became its director, and it remained a non-profit enterprise, eventually considered "the nation's most prestigious acting school," according to film historian James Lipton.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Student <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>, in a letter home to his parents, writes that Actors Studio was "the greatest school of the theater [and] the best thing that can happen to an actor". Playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a> said of its actors: "They act from the inside out. They communicate emotions they really feel. They give you a sense of life." Contemporary directors like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Lumet" title="Sidney Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>, a former student, have intentionally used actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, a former student skilled in "Method".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan directed one of the Studio's brightest young talents, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, in the stage adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>' <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i>. He cast him again in the film version in 1951, which made Brando a star and won 4 Oscars, and was nominated for 12.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the other Broadway plays he directed were "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof", "Sweet Bird of Youth", "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs" and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_and_Sympathy" title="Tea and Sympathy">Tea and Sympathy</a>", This led some, such as movie critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Bentley" title="Eric Bentley">Eric Bentley</a>, to write that "the work of Elia Kazan means more to the American theater than that of any current writer." Film critic David Richard Jones adds that Kazan, during the 1940s and 1950s, was one of America's foremost Stanislavskians, and "influenced thousands of contemporaries" in the theatre, film, and the Actors Studio that he helped found.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the height of his stage success, Kazan then turned to Hollywood where he soon demonstrated equal skill as director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films, but his first feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Tree_Grows_In_Brooklyn_(film)" title="A Tree Grows In Brooklyn (film)">A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</a></i> (1945), one his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which became his forte. Two years later he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gentleman%27s_Agreement" title="Gentleman's Agreement">Gentleman's Agreement</a></i>, where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in America, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1949 he again dealt with controversial subject when he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinky_(1949_film)" title="Pinky (1949 film)">Pinky</a></i>, which dealt with issues of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism" title="Racism">racism</a> in America, and was nominated for 3 Academy Awards.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1947, he directed the courtroom drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_(1947_film)" title="Boomerang (1947 film)">Boomerang!</a></i>, and in 1950 he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_in_the_Streets_(film)" title="Panic in the Streets (film)">Panic in the Streets</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Widmark" title="Richard Widmark">Richard Widmark</a>, in a thriller shot on the streets of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>. In the that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in "energizing" the action scenes. He won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival" title="Venice Film Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>, International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_Mostel" title="Zero Mostel">Zero Mostel</a> also act in the film, despite Mostel being "blacklisted" as a result of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HUAC" title="HUAC">HUAC</a> testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1951, after introducing and directing one of the Acting Studio's brightest young talents, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, in the stage version, he went on to cast him in film version of the play, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>, which made Brando a star and won 4 Oscars, being nominated for 12. The film popularized <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_acting" title="Method acting">Method acting</a> with Brando's role as the earthy and unmannered Stanley Kowalski opposite the classical dignity of British actress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, as his sister-in-law. Despite the plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater, however Kazan did at first used a more open setting but then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brando's role as a virtually unknown actor at age 27, would "catapult him to stardom." His next film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viva_Zapata!" title="Viva Zapata!">Viva Zapata!</a></i> (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando playing the role of Mexican revolutionary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Zapata" title="Emiliano Zapata">Emiliano Zapata</a>. The film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his "first real film" because of those factors.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1954 he again used Brando as co-star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>. As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New Yorkâ€™s longshoremanâ€™s union. It too was nominated for 12 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>, but won 8, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Picture" title="Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Actor" title="Best Actor">Best Actor</a>, for Marlon Brando. To some critics, Brando gives the "best performance in American film history," playing an ex-boxer, Terry Malloy, who is persuaded by a priest to inform on corrupt unions. Surprisingly, Brando writes that he was actually disappointed with his acting upon first watching the screening:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was also the screen debut for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Marie_Saint" title="Eva Marie Saint">Eva Marie Saint</a>, who won the Oscar for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Bernstein" title="Leonard Bernstein">Leonard Bernstein</a>. British film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Freer" title="Ian Freer">Ian Freer</a> notes that despite Kazan naming Communist party members to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Committee on Un-American Activities</a> two years earlier, "the film is ambivalent about the act of informing."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malden" title="Karl Malden">Karl Malden</a> became an early student at the Group Theater in 1937, where he first began acting under Kazan's direction. Kazan would play a "prominent role in Malden's stage and film career", including convincing him to change his name from Mladen Sekulovich. He played a drunken sailer in Kazan's "Truckline Cafe," which also included a young Marlon Brando. In 1947, he co-starred in the stage play "All My Sons," written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, with Kazan directing, and began being recognized as a serious actor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, his first major stage success was his role as an awkward suitor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> in "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a>", which also helped make Brando a star on stage. After two years in the role, he played the same part in the 1951 film version, where he won his first Oscar for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Best Supporting Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a>. Kazan next directed him in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i> (1954), where he was also nominated as Best Supporting Actor for his role as a sympathetic priest. In 1956, Kazan directed him in a starring role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Doll" title="Baby Doll">Baby Doll</a></i>, alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, a controversial story written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, and he was nominated for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a> for Best Actor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Malden remained friends with Kazan despite his unpopular appearance at the HUAC in 1952. Many mutual "friends who turned on Kazan also refused to speak to Malden." He furthered his support in 1999, when, as a member of the board of governors of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>, he proposed to the board that they give Kazan an honorary Oscar for "lifetime achievement". Malden's proposal was bold, as film festivals, critics associations, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>, had already refused to bestow similar honors due to Kazan's testimony given nearly 50 years earlier. Malden recalled giving his proposal:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, when Malden finished speaking, "he was greeted by a rousing burst of applause."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the success of <i>On the Waterfront</i> he went on to direct the screen adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck" title="John Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a>'s novel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_of_Eden_(film)" title="East of Eden (film)">East of Eden</a></i> in 1955. As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film's success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebel_Without_a_Cause" title="Rebel Without a Cause">Rebel Without a Cause</a></i> (1955), directed by Kazan's friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" title="Nicholas Ray">Nicholas Ray</a>, and then <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_(film)" title="Giant (film)">Giant</a></i>, (dir. George Stevens, 1956)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Author Douglas Rathgeb describes the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he "kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends." As a result, Kazan was forced to "baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers," so he wouldn't run away during production. Costar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Harris" title="Julie Harris">Julie Harris</a> worked overtime to quell Dean's panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood's methods, and Rathgeb notes that "his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood's corporate gears."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dean himself was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>. Ray watched Dean's powerful acting on the screen, but it didn't seem possible that it was the same person in the room, who Ray felt was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. "Dean himself did not seem to believe it," notes Rathgeb. "He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with an effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan's most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, while in an accident with his sports car outside of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was <i>East of Eden</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961, he introduced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> in his first screen appearance with a starring role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_in_the_Grass" title="Splendor in the Grass">Splendor in the Grass</a></i> (1961), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a>; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Biskind" title="Peter Biskind">Peter Biskind</a> points out that Kazan "was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn." Biskind notes also that they "were wildly dissimilarâ€”mentor vs. protege, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth." Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: "The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director's friendly testimony before the HUAC. He snapped, 'Lemme ask you something â€” why did you name all those names?'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beatty himself recalled the episode: "In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it." Biskind describes how "Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, 'What did you say?' and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room ... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours." Beatty, years later, during a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center" title="Kennedy Center">Kennedy Center</a> tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan "had given him the most important break in his career."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beatty's costar, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a>, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzanne_Finstad" title="Suzanne Finstad">Suzanne Finstad</a> notes that a "turning point" in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>: "She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh's performance... [who] became a role model for Natalie." In 1961, after a "series of bad films, her career was already in decline," notes Rathgeb. Kazan himself writes that the "sages" of the film community declared her as "washed up" as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan cast her as the female lead in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splendor_in_the_Grass" title="Splendor in the Grass">Splendor in the Grass</a></i>, and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, "working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on <i>Splendor.</i>" She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of "Kazan's wizardry ... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lockwood" title="Gary Lockwood">Gary Lockwood</a>, who also acted in the film, felt that "Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things ouf of her." Kazan's favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). "It's terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it," writes Kazan.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another aspect that contributed to the power and intensity of his films was his close collaboration with writers. On Broadway, he worked with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Inge" title="William Inge">William Inge</a>; in film, he worked again with Willams (<i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> and <i>Baby Doll</i>), Inge (<i>Splendor in the Grass</i>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a> (<i>On the Waterfront</i> and <i>A Face in the Crowd</i>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Steinbeck" title="John Steinbeck">John Steinbeck</a> (<i>Viva Zapata!</i>), and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Pinter" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a> (<i>The Last Tycoon</i>). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, "he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect." In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Loss_of_a_Teardrop_Diamond" title="The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond">The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond</a></i>, was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among his other films were <i>Panic in the Streets</i> (1950), (1955), <i>Baby Doll</i> (1956), <i>Wild River</i> (1960), and <i>The Last Tycoon</i> (1976). In between his directing work he wrote four best-selling novels, including <i>America, America</i>, and <i>The Arrangement</i>, in both of which he tells the story of his Greek immigrant ancestors. They were later made into films.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Directing_style">Directing style</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan strove for "cinematic realism," a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict "social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity." As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Remick" title="Lee Remick">Lee Remick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo_Van_Fleet" title="Jo Van Fleet">Jo Van Fleet</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Palance" title="Jack Palance">Jack Palance</a>, their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens,_Jr." title="George Stevens, Jr.">George Stevens, Jr.</a> that he felt that "big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits... they're not pliable anymore." Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on "reality", although his style was not defined as "naturalistic." She adds: "He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects." Kazan himself states that "unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn't cast him."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Biskind" title="Peter Biskind">Peter Biskind</a> described Kazan's career as "fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work." Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>, written by screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a>, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it "one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema." Another political film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Face_in_the_Crowd_(film)" title="A Face in the Crowd (film)">A Face in the Crowd</a></i> (1957). His protagonist, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffith" title="Andy Griffith">Andy Griffith</a> (in his film debut,) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a> were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn "of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation." Kazan states, "Listen to what the candidate says; don't be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don't buy the advertisement; buy what's in the package."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a product of the Group Theater and Actor's Studio, he was most noted for his use of "Method" actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, "I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance <i>including</i> so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends... The director is a <i>desperate beast!</i> ... You don't deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree." Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a> called him a "master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan, however, held strong ideas about the scenes, and would try to merge an actor's suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Doll" title="Baby Doll">Baby Doll</a></i>, for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>, he privately asked Wallach, "Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?" Wallach writes, "I hadn't thought about that question before, but I answered ... 'No.'" Kazan replies, "Good idea, play it that way." Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Joanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" title="Nicholas Ray">Nicholas Ray</a> considered him "the best actor's director the United States has ever produced." Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that "he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the actors who describe Kazan as an important influence in their career were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Neal" title="Patricia Neal">Patricia Neal</a>, who co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffith" title="Andy Griffith">Andy Griffith</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Face_in_the_Crowd_(film)" title="A Face in the Crowd (film)">A Face in the Crowd</a></i> (1957): "He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Franciosa" title="Anthony Franciosa">Anthony Franciosa</a>, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in order to get quality acting from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Griffith" title="Andy Griffith">Andy Griffith</a>, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls "an astonishing movie debut," Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: "I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don't know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Moore_(actress)" title="Terry Moore (actress)">Terry Moore</a> calls Kazan her "best friend," and notes that "he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life." "He would find out if your life was like the character," says <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>, star of <i>Baby Doll</i>, "he was the best director with actors."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan's need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Tycoon_(film)" title="The Last Tycoon (film)">The Last Tycoon</a></i> (1976). He remembers that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, the star of the film, "would do almost anything to succeed," and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro "is one of a select number of actors I've directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal character traits. Although he didn't know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, "Bobby is more meticulous ... he's very imaginative. He's very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He's a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates." Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro's acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that "for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in <i>The Godfather, part II</i>, ... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan remained controversial in some circles until his death for testimony he gave before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Committee on Un-American Activities</a> (HUAC) in 1952, a period that many, such as journalist Michael Mills, feel was "the most controversial period in Hollywood history." When he was in his mid 20s, during the "Depression" years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_of_the_United_States_of_America" title="Communist Party of the United States of America">Communist Party</a> in New York, for a year and a half.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 1952, the Committee called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Theatre_(New_York)" title="Group Theatre (New York)">Group Theater</a> members who he said had been Communists: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Odets" title="Clifford Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edward_Bromberg" title="J.

He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time that he did. All the persons named were already known to HUAC, however. The move cost Kazan many friends within the film industry, including that of playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, and cast a pall over his later career.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan would later write in his autobiography of the "warrior pleasure at withstanding his 'enemies.' When Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some refusing to applaud, and many others, such as actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> and producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens,_Jr." title="George Stevens, Jr.">George Stevens, Jr.</a> standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Los Angeles Times</i> film critic Kenneth Turan, agreed, writing "The only criterion for an award like this is the work". Kazan was already "denied accolades" from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>, and other film critics associations. According to Mills, "Itâ€™s time for the Academy to recognize this genius," adding that "We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Miller put his arm around Kazan and retorted, "donâ€™t worry about what Iâ€™ll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his memoirs, Kazan writes that his testimony meant that "the big shot had become the outsider." He also notes that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams "the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elia Kazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Kazan" title="Molly Kazan">Molly Day Thacher</a>. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons. His second marriage, to the actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Loden" title="Barbara Loden">Barbara Loden</a>, lasted from 1969 until her death in 1980, and produced one son.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan became known as an "actor's director" because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars, such as Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger, Karl Malden, James Dean, Julie Harris, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kazan never lost his identification with the oppressed people he remembered from the depths of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. With his many years with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Theatre_(New_York)" title="Group Theatre (New York)">Group Theater</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%27s_Studio" title="Actor's Studio">Actor's Studio</a> in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous "for the power and intensity of his actors' performances."

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon his death, at the age of 94, the <i>New York Times</i> described him as "one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history." His stage direction of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman" title="Death of a Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a></i> and <i>A Streetcar Named Desire</i> is considered a "high point of world theater" in the 20th century. Although he became a "legendary director on Broadway", he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major filmmakers of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career "he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations", adding that "he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema". Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesleyan_University" title="Wesleyan University">Wesleyan University</a> Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.</p>

He stated in an interview in 1976:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for excellence on stage and screen. In 1982, President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for life achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a>, who wrote <i>On the Waterfront</i>, thanks his lifelong friend saying, â€œElia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.â€&#157; In an interview with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> in 1976, Kazan spoke of his love of the cinema: "I think it's the most wonderful art in the world."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999, when he was 90 years old, Kazan received an honorary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> for lifetime achievement. During the ceremony, he was accompanied by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>.

Kazan appreciated the award:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his autobiography, <i>A Life</i>, he sums up the influence of filmmaking on his life:</p>

Scorsese was "captivated" by Kazan's films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker.</p>
