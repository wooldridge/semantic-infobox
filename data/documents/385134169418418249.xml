Although the stage cast was largely replaced with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> contract players, she was hired to reprise her role as Hermia.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanie_Wilkes" title="Melanie Wilkes">Melanie Hamilton Wilkes</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i> (1939) and was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</a> for her performance. In 1941, de Havilland became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized_citizen" title="Naturalized citizen">naturalized citizen</a> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. She was becoming increasingly frustrated by the roles assigned to her. She felt she had proven herself capable of playing more than the demure ingÃ©nues and damsels in distress that were quickly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting" title="Typecasting">typecasting</a> her, and began to reject scripts that offered her this type of role. When her Warner Bros. contract expired, the studio informed her that six months had been added to it for times she had been on suspension; the law then allowed for studios to suspend contract players for rejecting a role and the period of suspension to be added to the contract period. In theory, this allowed a studio to maintain indefinite control over an uncooperative contractee.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most accepted this situation, while a few tried to change the system. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> had mounted an unsuccessful lawsuit against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> in the 1930s. De Havilland mounted a lawsuit in the 1940s, supported by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> and was successful, thereby reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to the performers. The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood. Her victory won her the respect and admiration of her peers, among them her own sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a> who later commented, "Hollywood owes Olivia a great deal". The studio, however, vowed never to hire her again. The California Court of Appeal's ruling came to be informally known, and is still known to this day, as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Law" title="De Havilland Law">De Havilland Law</a> (California Labor Code Section 2855). It imposes a 7 year limit on contracts for service unless the employee agrees to an extension beyond that term.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devotion_(film)" title="Devotion (film)">Devotion</a></i>, a Hollywood biography of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bront%C3%AB" title="BrontÃ«">BrontÃ« sisters</a> filmed in 1943 but withheld from release during the suspension and litigation, de Havilland signed a three picture deal with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. The quality and variety of her roles began to improve. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a>, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Mirror_(film)" title="The Dark Mirror (film)">The Dark Mirror</a></i> (1946), noted the change, and stated that although she had always been "one of the prettiest women in movies", her recent performances had proven her acting ability. He commented that she did not possess "any remarkable talent, but her playing is thoughtful, quiet, detailed and well-sustained ... [a]nd an undivided pleasure to see." She won Best Actress Academy Awards for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Each_His_Own_(film)" title="To Each His Own (film)">To Each His Own</a></i> (1946) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heiress" title="The Heiress">The Heiress</a></i> (1949), and was also widely praised for her Academy Awardâ€“nominated performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snake_Pit" title="The Snake Pit">The Snake Pit</a></i> (1948). This was one of the earliest films to attempt a realistic portrayal of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a>, and de Havilland was lauded for her willingness to play a role that was completely devoid of glamor and that confronted such controversial subject matter. She won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards" title="New York Film Critics Circle Awards">New York Film Critics Award</a> for both <i>The Snake Pit</i> and <i>The Heiress</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland appeared sporadically in films after the 1950s and attributed this partly to the growing permissiveness of Hollywood films of the period. She declined the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois" title="Blanche DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>, allegedly citing the unsavory nature of some elements of the script and saying there were certain lines she could not allow herself to speak. De Havilland denied this in a 2006 interview, saying she had recently given birth to her son when offered the role, which had been a life altering experience, and was unable to relate to the material. The role went to her <i>Gone with the Wind</i> co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, who won her second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for her role. De Havilland continued acting on film until the late 1970s, afterward continuing her career on television until the late 1980s, highlighted by her winning a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> and earning a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for her performance as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)">Dowager Empress Maria</a> in the 1986 miniseries <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia:_The_Mystery_of_Anna" title="Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna">Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna</a></i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> were known as one of Hollywood's most exciting on-screen couples, appearing in eight films together, but contrary to salacious rumours, were never linked romantically.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland stated, "He never guessed I had a crush on him. And it didn't get better either. In fact, I read in something that he wrote that he was in love with me when we made <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i> the next year, in 1936. I was amazed to read that, for it never occurred to me that he was smitten with me, too, even though we did all those pictures together." However, in an interview cited on Turner Classic Movies de Havilland claims she knew the crush was reciprocal and further states that Flynn proposed, though de Havilland turned down the proposal as Flynn was at the time still married to actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Damita" title="Lili Damita">Lili Damita</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland married novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Goodrich" title="Marcus Goodrich">Marcus Goodrich</a> in 1946 and they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorced</a> in 1953.

She was married to French journalist and <i>Paris Match</i> editor Pierre Galante between 1955 until 1979. Their daughter, Giselle (GisÃ¨le in French), who later became a journalist, was born in July 1956 when de Havilland was 40. After the divorce, de Havilland and Galante remained on good terms, and she nursed him through his final illness (lung cancer) in Paris, which was the stated reason for her absence from the 70th anniversary of the Oscars in 1998.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the two sisters, Olivia was the first to become an actress; when Joan tried to follow her lead, their mother, who allegedly favored Olivia, refused to let her use the family name. So Joan was forced to invent a name, taking first Joan Burfield, and later Joan Fontaine. Biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Higham_(biographer)" title="Charles Higham (biographer)">Charles Higham</a> records that the sisters have always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia would rip up the clothes Joan had to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to sew them back together. A lot of the feud and resentment between the sisters allegedly stems from Joan's perception of Olivia being their mother's favorite child.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both Olivia and Joan were nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> in 1942. Joan won first for her role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicion_(film)" title="Suspicion (film)">Suspicion</a></i> (1941) over Olivia's performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Back_the_Dawn" title="Hold Back the Dawn">Hold Back the Dawn</a></i>. Charles Higham states that Joan "felt guilty about winning given her lack of obsessive career drive...". Higham has described the events of the awards ceremony, stating that as Joan stepped forward to collect her award, she pointedly rejected Olivia's attempts at congratulating her and that Olivia was both offended and embarrassed by her behavior. Several years later, Olivia would remember the slight and exact her own revenge by brushing past Joan, who was waiting with her hand extended, because Olivia had allegedly taken offense at a comment Joan had made about Olivia's husband. Olivia's relationship with Joan continued to deteriorate after the two incidents. Charles Higham has stated that this was the near final straw for what would become a lifelong feud, but the sisters did not completely stop speaking to each other until 1975. According to Joan, Olivia did not invite her to a memorial service for their mother, who had recently died. Olivia claims she told Joan, but that Joan had brushed her off, claiming that she was too busy to attend.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charles Higham records that Joan has an estranged relationship with her own daughters as well, possibly because she discovered that they were secretly maintaining a relationship with their aunt Olivia. Both sisters have refused to comment publicly about their feud and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family" title="Dysfunctional family">dysfunctional family</a> relationships.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A resident of Paris since the 1950s, de Havilland rarely makes public appearances.

The engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Twelve Oaks, Scarlett notices that she is being admired by a handsome but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue" title="Rogue">roguish</a> visitor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>), who had been disowned by his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a> family. Rhett finds himself in further disfavor among the male guests when, during a discussion of the probability of war, he states that the South has no chance against the superior numbers and industrial might of the North. Scarlett sneaks out of her afternoon nap to be alone with Ashley in the library, and she confesses her love for him. He admits he finds Scarlett attractive, and that he has always secretly loved her back, but says that he and the sweet Melanie are more compatible. She accuses Ashley of misleading her to think that he did love her and slaps him in anger. Ashley silently exits and her anger continues when she realizes that Rhett was taking an afternoon nap on the couch in the library, and has overheard the whole conversation. "Sir, you are no gentleman!" she protests, to which he replies, "And you, miss, are no lady!" Nevertheless, Rhett promises to keep her guilty secret. Scarlett leaves the library in haste and the barbecue is disrupted by the announcement that war has broken out, so the men rush to enlist, and all the ladies are awakened from their naps. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye from the upstairs window, Melanieâ€™s shy young brother Charles Hamilton (Rand Brooks), with whom Scarlett had been innocently flirting, asks for her hand in marriage before he goes. Despite not truly loving Charles, Scarlett consents in order to get close to the family and make Ashley jealous. Charles and Scarlett are married before he leaves to fight.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scarlett is quickly widowed when Charles dies from a bout with pneumonia and measles while serving in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the Oâ€™Haras' outspoken housemaid Mammy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel" title="Hattie McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>) tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashleyâ€™s return. Scarlett and Melanie attend a charity bazaar in Atlanta; Scarlett, who should be buried in deep mourning, is turned against and whispered about. Rhett, now a heroic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>, makes a surprise appearance. Scarlett shocks Atlanta society even more by accepting Rhett's large bid for a dance. While they dance, Rhett tells her of his intention to win her, which she says will never happen, as long as she lives.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashleyâ€™s heart while he is visiting on Christmas <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss while in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he leaves for the war. In the Hospital, Scarlett and Melanie care for the Reminiscent Soldier (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Edwards" title="Cliff Edwards">Cliff Edwards</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Melanie goes into a premature and difficult labor. Staying true to a promise Scarlett made to Ashley to "take care of Melanie," she and her young house servant Prissy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_McQueen" title="Butterfly McQueen">Butterfly McQueen</a>) must deliver the child without medical attendance. Scarlett calls upon Rhett to bring her home to Tara immediately with Melanie, Prissy, and the baby. He appears with a horse and wagon to take them out of the city on a perilous journey through the burning depot and warehouse district. He leaves her with a nearly dead horse, helplessly sick Melanie, her baby, and tearful Prissy, and with a passionate kiss on the road leading to Tara. She repays him rudely with a slap, to his bemusement, as he goes off to fight with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_of_Tennessee" title="Army of Tennessee">Confederate Army</a>. On her journey back home, Scarlett finds Twelve Oaks burned out, ruined and deserted. She is relieved to find Tara still standing but it has been deserted by all except her parents, her sisters, and two servants, Mammy and Pork (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Polk" title="Oscar Polk">Oscar Polk</a>). Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father's mind has begun to crumble under the strain. With Tara pillaged by Union troops, and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself: "As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!"</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermission" title="Intermission">intermission</a> is displayed after this.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scarlett sets her family and servants to picking the cotton fields. She also kills a Union deserter who threatens her during a burglary, and finds gold coins in his haversack, enough to sustain her family and servants for a short time. With the defeat of the Confederacy and war's end, Ashley returns from being a prisoner of war. Mammy restrains Scarlett from running to him when he reunites with Melanie. The dispirited Ashley finds he is of little help to Tara, and when Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Gerald O'Hara dies after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase from his property a Yankee <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpetbagger" title="Carpetbagger">carpetbagger</a>, the former overseer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Jory" title="Victor Jory">Victor Jory</a>) of his plantation who now wants to buy Tara. Scarlett is left to support the family, and realizes she cannot pay the rising taxes on Tara. Knowing that Rhett is in Atlanta and believing he is still rich, she has Mammy make an elaborate gown for her from her motherâ€™s drapes still hanging in the parlor. However, upon her visit, Rhett, now in jail, tells her his foreign bank accounts have been blocked, and that her attempt to get his money has been in vain.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Scarlett departs Rhett in jail, she encounters her sisterâ€™s fiancÃ©, the middle-aged Frank Kennedy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Nye" title="Carroll Nye">Carroll Nye</a>), who now owns a successful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_store" title="General store">general store</a> and lumber mill. Scarlett lies saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another beau. After becoming Mrs. Frank Kennedy, Scarlett takes over his business, too and with the profits, buys a sawmill which becomes very profitable during the rebuilding of Atlantaâ€”in part because she is willing to trade with the despised Yankee carpetbaggers and use convict laborers in her mill. When Ashley is about to take a job offer with a bank in the north, Scarlett preys on his weakness by weeping that she needs him to help run the mill; pressured by the sympathetic Melanie, he relents. One day, after Scarlett is attacked while driving alone through a nearby <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantytown" title="Shantytown">shantytown</a>, Frank, Ashley, and others make a night raid on the shantytown. Ashley is wounded in a melee with Union troops, and Frank is killed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With Frankâ€™s funeral barely over, Rhett visits Scarlett, and proposes marriage. Scarlett takes him up on his offer, partially for his money. He kisses her passionately and tells her that he will win her love one day because they are both the same. After a honeymoon in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans,_Louisiana" title="New Orleans, Louisiana">New Orleans</a>, Rhett promises to restore Tara to its former grandeur, while Scarlett builds the biggest mansion in Atlanta. The two have a daughter. Scarlett wants to name her Eugenie Victoria, but Rhett names her Bonnie Blue Butler (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cammie_King" title="Cammie King">Cammie King</a>). Rhett adores her as a symbol of the spirited but less grasping girl that Scarlett was before the war. He does everything to win the good opinion of Atlanta society for his daughterâ€™s sake. Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure (her waist has gone from eighteen-and-a-half inches to twenty), lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed. In anger, he kicks open the door that separates their bedrooms to show her that she could not keep him away if he wanted to be with her.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When visiting the mill one day, Scarlett listens to a nostalgic Ashley, and when she consoles him with an embrace, they are spied by two gossips including Ashley's sister India (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Rhett" title="Alicia Rhett">Alicia Rhett</a>), who hates Scarlett. They eagerly spread the rumor and Scarlettâ€™s reputation is again sullied. Later that night, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett out of bed and to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her beloved sister-in-law, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Rhett walks out the door, planning to return to his hometown of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston,_South_Carolina" title="Charleston, South Carolina">Charleston</a>, she pleads, "Rhett, if you go, where shall I go? What shall I do?" He famously answers, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankly,_my_dear,_I_don%27t_give_a_damn" title="Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn">Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn</a>" and walks away into the fog. She sits on her stairs and weeps in despair, "What is there that matters?" She then recalls the voices of Gerald, Ashley and Rhett, all of whom remind her that her strength comes from Tara itself. Hope lights Scarlett's face: "Tara! Home. I'll go home, and I'll think of some way to get him back! After all, tomorrow is another day!" In the finale, Scarlett stands once more, resolute, before Tara.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of original screenplay writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Howard" title="Sidney Howard">Sidney Howard</a>, film historian Joanne Yeck writes, "reducing the intricacies of <i>Gone with the Wind'</i>s epic dimensions was a herculean task...and Howard's first submission was far too long, and would have required at least six hours of film; ... [producer] Selznick wanted Howard to remain on the set to make revisions...but Howard refused to leave New England [and] as a result, revisions were handled by a host of local writers, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>..."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> replaced the film's director three weeks into filming and then had the script rewritten. He sought out director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Fleming" title="Victor Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>, who, at the time, was directing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>. Fleming was dissatisfied with the script, so Selznick brought in famed writer Ben Hecht to rewrite the entire screenplay within five days." The popular play <i>Moonlight and Magnolias</i> by playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Hutchinson_(screenwriter)" title="Ron Hutchinson (screenwriter)">Ron Hutchinson</a>, is about this dramatic episode when "Selznick literally locked himself, Fleming and screenwriter Ben Hecht in a room for five days to completely redo the script."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the time of the film's release in 1939, there was some question as to who should receive screen credit," writes Yeck. "But despite the number of writers and changes, the final script was remarkably close to Howard's version. The fact that Howard's name alone appears on the credits may have been as much a gesture to his memory as to his writing, for in 1939 Sidney Howard died tragically at age forty-eight in a farm-tractor accident, and before the movie's premiere."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Hecht biographer, William MacAdams, "At dawn on Sunday, February 20, 1939, David Selznick ... and director Victor Fleming shook Hecht awake to inform him he was on loan from MGM and must come with them immediately and go to work on <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, which Selznick had begun shooting five weeks before. It was costing Selznick $50,000 each day the film was on hold waiting for a final screenplay rewrite and time was of the essence.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hecht was in the middle of working on the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Circus" title="At the Circus">At the Circus</a></i> for the Marx brothers." Recalling the episode in a letter to screenwriter friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Fowler" title="Gene Fowler">Gene Fowler</a>, he said he hadn't read the novel but Selznick and director Fleming could not wait for him to read it. They would act out scenes based on Sidney Howard's original script which needed to be rewritten in a hurry. Hecht wrote, "After each scene had been performed and discussed, I sat down at the typewriter and wrote it out. Selznick and Fleming, eager to continue with their acting, kept hurrying me. We worked in this fashion for seven days, putting in eighteen to twenty hours a day. Selznick refused to let us eat lunch, arguing that food would slow us up. He provided bananas and salted peanuts....thus on the seventh day I had completed, unscathed, the first nine reels of the Civil War epic."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MacAdams writes, "It is impossible to determine exactly how much Hecht scripted...In the official credits filed with the Screen Writers' Guild, Sidney Howard was of course awarded the sole screen credit, but four other writers were appended ... Jo Swerling for contributing to the treatment, Oliver H. P. Garrett and Barbara Keon to screenplay construction, and Hecht, to dialogue, so it would appear Hecht's influence was not insubstantial."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, head of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selznick_International_Pictures" title="Selznick International Pictures">Selznick International Pictures</a>, decided that he wanted to create a film based on the novel, after his story editor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_B._Barrett" title="Kay B. Barrett">Kay Brown</a>, urged him to buy the film rights. A month after the book's publication in June 1936, Selznick bought the rights for $50,000, a record amount at the time. Major financing for the film was provided by Selznick's business partner <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hay_Whitney" title="John Hay Whitney">John Hay Whitney</a>, a financier who later went on to become a U.S. ambassador.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The casting of the two lead roles became a complex, two-year endeavor.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a> was actually the choice of the novel's author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mitchell" title="Margaret Mitchell">Margaret Mitchell</a>. Mitchell felt that Hopkins was just the right type of actress to play Scarlett as written in the book. However, Hopkins was in her mid thirties at the time and was considered too old for the part. Nevertheless, Hopkins had one advantage over the other actressesâ€”she was a native of Georgia.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Four actresses, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Bennett" title="Joan Bennett">Joan Bennett</a>, were still under consideration by December 1938. But only two finalists, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette_Goddard" title="Paulette Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, were tested in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>, both on December 20. Selznick had been quietly considering Vivien Leigh, a young English actress little known in America, for the role of Scarlett since February 1938, when Selznick saw her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Over_England" title="Fire Over England">Fire Over England</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Yank_at_Oxford" title="A Yank at Oxford">A Yank at Oxford</a></i>. Leigh's American agent was the London representative of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Selznick" title="Myron Selznick">Myron Selznick</a> talent agency (headed by David Selznick's brother, one of the owners of Selznick International), and she had requested in February that her name be submitted for consideration as Scarlett. By summer of 1938, the Selznicks were negotiating with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Korda" title="Alexander Korda">Alexander Korda</a>, to whom Leigh was under contract, for her services later that year. But for publicity reasons David arranged to meet her for the first time on the night of December 10, 1938, when the burning of the Atlanta Depot was filmed. The story was invented for the press that Leigh and Laurence Olivier were just visiting the studio as guests of Myron Selznick, who was also Olivier's agent, and that Leigh was in Hollywood hoping for a part in Olivier's current movie, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights_(1939_film)" title="Wuthering Heights (1939 film)">Wuthering Heights</a></i>. In a letter to his wife two days later, Selznick admitted that Leigh was "the Scarlett dark horse", and after a series of screen tests, her casting was announced on January 13, 1939. Just before the shooting of the film, Selznick informed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a>: "Scarlett O'Hara's parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the role of Rhett Butler, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a> was an almost immediate favorite for both the public and Selznick. Nevertheless, as Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> was Selznick's first choice, because Cooper's contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> involved a common distribution company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Artists" title="United Artists">United Artists</a>, with which Selznick had an eight-picture deal. However, Goldwyn remained noncommittal in negotiations. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Bros.</a> offered a package of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> for the lead roles in return for the distribution rights. But by then Selznick was determined to get Clark Gable, and eventually found a way to borrow him from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. Selznick's father-in-law, MGM chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a>, offered in May 1938 to fund half of the movie's budget in return for a powerful package: 50% of the profits would go to MGM, the movie's distribution would be credited to MGM's parent company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loew%27s" title="Loew's">Loew's, Inc.</a>, and Loew's would receive 15 percent of the movie's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_income" title="Gross income">gross income</a>. Selznick accepted this offer in August, and Gable was cast. Nevertheless, the arrangement to release through MGM meant delaying the start of production until Selznick International completed its eight-picture contract with United Artists.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal photography began January 26, 1939, and ended on June 27, 1939, with post-production work (including a fifth version of the opening scene) going to November 11, 1939. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a>, with whom Selznick had a long working relationship, and who had spent almost two years in preproduction on <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, was replaced after less than three weeks of shooting. Olivia de Havilland said that she learned of George Cukor's firing from Vivien Leigh on the day the Atlanta bazaar scene was filmed. The pair went to Selznick's office in full costume and begged him to change his mind. Selznick apologized, but refused. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Fleming" title="Victor Fleming">Victor Fleming</a>, who was directing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz_(1939_film)" title="The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)">The Wizard of Oz</a></i>, was called in from MGM to complete the picture, although Cukor continued privately to coach Leigh and De Havilland.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Selznick was asked by the press in early September how he felt about the film, he said: "At noon I think it's divine, at midnight I think it's lousy. Sometimes I think it's the greatest picture ever made. But if it's only a great picture, I'll still be satisfied."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On September 9, 1939, Selznick, his wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Mayer_Selznick" title="Irene Mayer Selznick">Irene</a>, investor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Whitney" title="Jock Whitney">Jock Whitney</a>, and film editor Hal Kern drove out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside,_California" title="Riverside, California">Riverside, California</a> with all of the film reels to preview it before an audience. The film was still unfinished at this stage, missing many optical effects and most of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Steiner" title="Max Steiner">Max Steiner</a>'s music score. They arrived at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Fox_Theater" title="Riverside Fox Theater">Fox Theatre</a> in Riverside, which was playing a double feature of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hawaiian_Nights&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Hawaiian Nights (page does not exist)">Hawaiian Nights</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Geste_(1939_film)" title="Beau Geste (1939 film)">Beau Geste</a></i>. Kern called for the manager and explained that they had selected his theatre for the first public screening of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>. He was told that after <i>Hawaiian Nights</i> had finished, he could make an announcement of the preview, but was forbidden to say what the film was. People were permitted to leave, but the theatre would thereafter be sealed with no re-admissions and no phone calls out. The manager was reluctant, but finally agreed. His only request was to call his wife to come to the theatre immediately. Kern stood by him as he made the call to make sure he did not reveal the name of the film to her.</p>

When the film ended there was a huge ovation. In the preview cards filled out after the screening, two-thirds of the audience rated it as excellent, an unusually high rating. Most of the audience begged that the film not be cut shorter, and many suggested that instead, they eliminate any newsreels, shorts and B-movie feature.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film premiered in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, on December 15, 1939.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hattie McDaniel, as well as the other black actors from the film, were prevented from attending the premiere due to Georgia's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Crow" title="Jim Crow">Jim Crow</a> laws, which would have kept them from sitting with the white members of the cast.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Gone with the Wind</i> was given theatrical re-releases in 1947, 1954 and 1961. It was re-released in 1967 in a 70Â mm stereophonic version, which is best known today for its iconic poster. It was further rereleased in 1971, 1989, and by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema" title="New Line Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> in 1998. The 1954 release was the first time the studio issued the film in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen" title="Widescreen">widescreen</a>, compromising the original <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_ratio" title="Academy ratio">Academy ratio</a> and cropping the top and bottom to an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. In doing so, a number of shots were optically re-framed and cut into the three-strip camera negatives, forever altering five shots in the film. The 70Â mm re-issue of the film cropped the film further, to a very narrow ratio of 2.20:1. The 1998 theatrical reissue and the VHS and DVD releases restored the film to its original aspect ratio. On November 14, 2009, on the occasion of the film's 70th anniversary, the film was re-issued in a new high definition transfer to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc" title="Blu-ray Disc">Blu-ray</a> format. When adjusted for inflation, <i>Gone with the Wind</i> is estimated to be the highest grossing film domestically of all time.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film made its television debut on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" title="HBO">HBO</a> cable network in June 1976, and its broadcast TV debut in November of that year in two parts on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> network, where it became at that time the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_television_broadcasts" title="List of most-watched television broadcasts">highest-rated television program</a> ever presented on a single network, watched by 47.5 percent of the households sampled in America, and 65 percent of television viewers. Ironically, it was surpassed the following year by the mini-series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roots_(TV_miniseries)" title="Roots (TV miniseries)">Roots</a></i>, a saga about slavery in America.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rumors of Hollywood producing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequel" title="Sequel">sequel</a> to this film persisted for decades until 1994, when a sequel was finally produced for television, based upon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Ripley" title="Alexandra Ripley">Alexandra Ripley</a>'s novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_(novel)" title="Scarlett (novel)">Scarlett</a></i>, itself a sequel to Mitchell's book. Both the book and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini-series" title="Mini-series">mini-series</a> were met with mixed reviews. In the TV version, British actors played both key roles: Welsh-born actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Dalton" title="Timothy Dalton">Timothy Dalton</a> played Rhett while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester" title="Manchester">Manchester</a>-born <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Whalley" title="Joanne Whalley">Joanne Whalley</a> played Scarlett. Original plans were used for the reconstruction of a replica of the original Tara set in Charleston, South Carolina for the filming.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rhett Butler's infamous farewell line to Scarlett O'Hara, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankly,_my_dear,_I_don%27t_give_a_damn" title="Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn">Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn</a>", was voted in a poll by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> in 2005 as the most memorable line in cinema history.</p>

The AFI also ranked the film #2 in their list of the greatest romances of all time (100 Years... 100 Passions).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After filming concluded, the set of Tara sat on the back lot of the former Selznick Studios as the Forty Acres back lot reverted to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> and then was sold to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desilu_Productions" title="Desilu Productions">Desilu Productions</a>. In 1959, Southern Attractions, Inc. purchased the faÃ§ade of Tara, which was dismantled and shipped to Georgia with plans to relocate it to the Atlanta area as a tourist attraction. David O. Selznick commented at the time,</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, the Margaret Mitchell estate refused to license the novel's commercial use in connection with the faÃ§ade, citing Mitchell's dismay at how little it resembled her description. In 1979 the dismantled plywood and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9" title="Papier-mÃ¢chÃ©">papier-mÃ¢chÃ©</a> set, reportedly in "terrible" condition, was purchased for $5,000 by Betty Talmadge, the ex-wife of former Georgia governor and U.S. senator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Talmadge" title="Herman Talmadge">Herman Talmadge</a>. She lent the front door of Tara's set to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mitchell_House_and_Museum" title="Margaret Mitchell House and Museum">Margaret Mitchell House and Museum</a> in downtown Atlanta, Georgia where it is on permanent display, featured in the Gone with the Wind film museum. Other items from the movie, such as from the set of Scarlett and Rhett's Atlanta mansion, are still stored at The Culver Studios (formerly Selznick International) including the stained glass window from the top of the staircase which was actually a painting. The famous painting of Scarlett in her blue dress, which hung in Rhett's bedroom, hung for years at the Margaret Mitchell Elementary School in Atlanta, but is now on permanent loan to the Margaret Mitchell Museum, complete with stains from the glass of sherry that Rhett Butler threw at it in anger.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recent historical studies of the Civil Rights Movement have focused on the idyllic portrayal (epitomised in the opening credits) of the Civil War-era South in the film. Professor D.J. Reynolds wrote that "The white women are elegant, their menfolk noble or at least dashing. And, in the background, the black slaves are mostly dutiful and content, clearly incapable of an independent existence." Reynolds likened <i>Gone with the Wind</i> to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation" title="Birth of a Nation">Birth of a Nation</a></i> (based on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clansman" title="The Clansman">The Clansman</a></i>) and other re-imaginings of the South during the era of segregation, in which white Southerners are portrayed as defending traditional values and the issue of slavery is largely ignored. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel" title="Hattie McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>'s performance (for which she became the first black American to win an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a>) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_McQueen" title="Butterfly McQueen">Butterfly McQueen</a>'s have been described as stereotypes of a 'black <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammy_archetype" title="Mammy archetype">Mammy</a>' and a child-like black slave (in the novel, the character of Prissy was twelve years old, but played in the film by an adult). <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X" title="Malcolm X">Malcolm X</a> recalled that "when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_McQueen" title="Butterfly McQueen">Butterfly McQueen</a> went into her act, I felt like crawling under the rug."</p>
