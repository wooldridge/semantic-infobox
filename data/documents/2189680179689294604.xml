However, a very similar deathbed saying was earlier attributed to a similarly named 19th-century English actor, Edmund Kean, so the association of the words with Gwenn may be erroneous.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kris Kringle (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gwenn" title="Edmund Gwenn">Edmund Gwenn</a>) is indignant to find that the person (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Helton" title="Percy Helton">Percy Helton</a>) assigned to play Santa in the annual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s_Thanksgiving_Day_Parade" title="Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade">Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade</a> is intoxicated. When he complains to event director Doris Walker (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a>), she persuades Kris to take his place. He does such a fine job that he is hired to be the Santa for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s" title="Macy's">Macy's</a> flagship <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> store on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/34th_Street" title="34th Street">34th Street</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ignoring instructions to steer parents to goods that Macy's wants to sell, Kris tells one shopper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Ritter" title="Thelma Ritter">Thelma Ritter</a>) to go to another store for a fire engine for her son that Macy's doesn't have. She is so impressed, she tells Julian Shellhammer (Philip Tonge), head of the toy department, that she will become a loyal customer. Kris later informs another mother that archrival <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbels" title="Gimbels">Gimbels</a> has better skates for her daughter.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fred Gailey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Payne_(actor)" title="John Payne (actor)">John Payne</a>), an attorney and neighbor of Doris, is babysitting the young divorcee's six-year-old daughter Susan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a>) and takes her to see Kris. When Doris finds out, she lectures Fred about filling Susan's mind with fantasy. Meanwhile, Susan sees Kris talking and singing with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands" title="Netherlands">Dutch</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> orphan girl in her native tongue and begins to wonder if perhaps Kris is real. When Doris asks Kris to tell Susan that he really isn't Santa Claus, Kris surprises her by insisting that he is.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Doris decides to fire him, fearing he might harm someone. However, Kris has generated so much good publicity and customer goodwill for Macy's that a delighted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowland_Hussey_Macy" title="Rowland Hussey Macy">R. H. Macy</a> (Harry Antrim) promises Doris and Shellhammer generous bonuses. To overcome Doris's misgivings, Shellhammer proposes getting Granville Sawyer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porter_Hall" title="Porter Hall">Porter Hall</a>) to give Kris a "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_evaluation" title="Psychological evaluation">psychological evaluation</a>". Kris easily passes the test, but antagonizes Sawyer by questioning Sawyer's own psychological health.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pierce (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Seay" title="James Seay">James Seay</a>), the doctor at Kris's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nursing_home" title="Nursing home">nursing home</a>, assures Doris and Shellhammer that Kris's delusion is harmless. Meanwhile, Fred offers to let Kris stay with him so he can be closer to work. Kris makes a deal with Fred â€“ he will work on Susan's cynicism while Fred does the same with the disillusioned Doris, still bitter over her failed marriage.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then Kris learns that Sawyer has convinced a young, impressionable employee, Alfred (Alvin Greenman), that he is mentally ill simply because he is generous and kind-hearted (Alfred plays Santa Claus at his neighborhood <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" title="YMCA">YMCA</a>). Kris confronts Sawyer and, in a fit of anger, raps him on the head with his cane. Doris and Shellhammer only see the aftermath; Sawyer exaggerates his injury in order to have Kris confined to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue_Hospital" title="Bellevue Hospital">Bellevue Mental Hospital</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Tricked into cooperating and believing Doris to be part of the deception, a discouraged Kris deliberately fails his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_examination" title="Mental examination">mental examination</a> and is recommended for permanent commitment. However, Fred persuades Kris not to give up. To secure his release, Fred gets a formal hearing before Judge Henry X. Harper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Lockhart" title="Gene Lockhart">Gene Lockhart</a>) of the New York Supreme Court. Ordered by Mr. Macy to get the matter dropped, Sawyer pleads with Fred not to seek publicity. To Sawyer's dismay, Fred thanks him for the idea. As a result, Judge Harper is put in an awkward spot â€“ even his own grandchildren are against him for "persecuting" Santa Claus.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the hearing, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Attorney" title="District Attorney">District Attorney</a> Thomas Mara (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerome_Cowan" title="Jerome Cowan">Jerome Cowan</a>) gets Kris to assert that he is in fact Santa Claus and rests his case, believing he has <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prima_facie" title="Prima facie">prima facie</a></i> proven his point. Fred stuns the court by arguing that Kris is not insane because he actually <i>is</i> Santa Claus â€“ and he will prove it. Mara requests the judge rule that Santa Claus does not exist. Harper is warned privately in chambers by his political adviser, Charlie Halloran (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Frawley" title="William Frawley">William Frawley</a>), that doing so would be disastrous for his upcoming reelection bid. The judge buys time by deciding to hear evidence before ruling.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fred calls R.H. Macy as a witness. Mara pointedly asks if he <i>really</i> believes Kris to be Santa Claus. Macy starts to equivocate, but when Mara asks him point-blank, Macy remembers the expressions on the faces of small children upon seeing Kris and firmly states, "I do!" On leaving the stand, Macy fires Sawyer. Fred then calls Mara's own young son to the stand. Thomas Mara Jr. testifies that his father had told him that Santa was real and that "My daddy would <i>never</i> tell a lie!" Outmaneuvered, Mara concedes the point.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mara then demands that Fred prove that Kris is "the one and only" Santa Claus on the basis of some competent authority. While Fred searches frantically, Susan, by now a firm believer in Kris, writes him a letter to cheer him up, which Doris also signs. A mail sorter (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Albertson" title="Jack Albertson">Jack Albertson</a>) sees that it is addressed to the courthouse and realizes that the post office could clear out the many letters to Santa taking up space in its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_letter_office" title="Dead letter office">dead letter office</a> by delivering them to Kris.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kris is uplifted by Susan's letter. Just then, Fred learns that over 50,000 pieces of mail have been delivered to Kris.
