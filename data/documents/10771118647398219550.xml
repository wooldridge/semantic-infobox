	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Martin Scorsese was born in New York City. His father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Charles_Scorsese" title="Luciano Charles Scorsese">Luciano Charles Scorsese</a> (1913â€“1993), and mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Scorsese" title="Catherine Scorsese">Catherine Scorsese</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Cappa; 1912â€“1997), both worked in New York's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garment_District,_Manhattan" title="Garment District, Manhattan">Garment District</a>. His father was a clothes presser and his mother was a seamstress. As a boy, his parents would often take him to movie theatres; it was at this stage in his life that he developed passion for cinema. Enamored of historical epics in his adolescence, at least two films of the genre, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_the_Pharaohs" title="Land of the Pharaohs">Land of the Pharaohs</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Cid_(film)" title="El Cid (film)">El Cid</a></i>, appear to have had a deep and lasting impact on his cinematic psyche. Scorsese also developed an admiration for neorealist cinema at this time. He recounted its influence in a documentary on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_neorealism" title="Italian neorealism">Italian neorealism</a>, and commented on how <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bicycle_Thief" title="The Bicycle Thief">The Bicycle Thief</a></i> alongside <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pais%C3%A0" title="PaisÃ ">PaisÃ </a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome,_Open_City" title="Rome, Open City">Rome, Open City</a></i> inspired him and how this influenced his view or portrayal of his Sicilian genes. In his documentary, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Mio_Viaggio_in_Italia" title="Il Mio Viaggio in Italia">Il Mio Viaggio in Italia</a></i>, Scorsese noted that the Sicilian episode of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rossellini" title="Roberto Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>'s <i>PaisÃ </i> which he first saw on television alongside his relatives, who were themselves Sicilian immigrants, made a significant impact on his life. He has also cited filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyajit_Ray" title="Satyajit Ray">Satyajit Ray</a> as a major influence on his career. His initial desire to become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priest" title="Priest">priest</a> while attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Hayes_High_School" title="Cardinal Hayes High School">Cardinal Hayes High School</a> in the Bronx was forsaken for cinema, and, consequently, Scorsese enrolled in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisch_School_of_the_Arts" title="Tisch School of the Arts">NYU Tisch School of the Arts</a>, where he received his M.F.A. in film directing in 1966.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese has been married five times. His first wife was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Laraine_Marie_Brennan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Laraine Marie Brennan (page does not exist)">Laraine Marie Brennan</a>; they have a daughter, Catherine. He married the writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Cameron" title="Julia Cameron">Julia Cameron</a> in 1976; they have a daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Domenica_Cameron-Scorsese&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Domenica Cameron-Scorsese (page does not exist)">Domenica Cameron-Scorsese</a>, who is an actress and appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence_(film)" title="The Age of Innocence (film)">The Age of Innocence</a></i>, but the marriage lasted only a year. He was married to actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_Rossellini" title="Isabella Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a> from 1979 to their divorce in 1983. He then married producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_De_Fina" title="Barbara De Fina">Barbara De Fina</a> in 1985; their marriage ended in divorce as well, in 1991. He has been married to Helen Morris since 1999; they have a daughter, Francesca, who appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Departed" title="The Departed">The Departed</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aviator" title="The Aviator">The Aviator</a></i>. He is primarily based in New York City.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a>'s film school (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_Degree" title="Bachelor's Degree">B.A.</a>, English, 1964; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Fine_Arts" title="Master of Fine Arts">M.F.A.</a>, film, 1966) making the short films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_a_Nice_Girl_Like_You_Doing_in_a_Place_Like_This%3F" title="What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?">What's a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?</a></i> (1963) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_Not_Just_You,_Murray!" title="It's Not Just You, Murray!">It's Not Just You, Murray!</a></i> (1964). His most famous short of the period is the darkly comic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Shave" title="The Big Shave">The Big Shave</a></i> (1967), which featured Peter Bernuth who shaves himself until profusely bleeding, ultimately slitting his own throat with his razor. The film is an indictment of America's involvement in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a>, suggested by its alternative title <i>Viet '67</i>. Scorsese has mentioned on several occasions that he was greatly inspired in his early days at New York University by his Armenian-American film professor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haig_P._Manoogian" title="Haig P. Manoogian">Haig P. Manoogian</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1967, Scorsese made his first feature-length film, the black and white <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Call_First" title="I Call First">I Call First</a></i>, which was later retitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who%27s_That_Knocking_at_My_Door" title="Who's That Knocking at My Door">Who's That Knocking at My Door</a></i> with fellow student, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" title="Harvey Keitel">Harvey Keitel</a>, and editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Schoonmaker" title="Thelma Schoonmaker">Thelma Schoonmaker</a>, both of whom were to become long-term collaborators. This film was intended to be the first of Scorsese's semi-autobiographical 'J.R. Trilogy', which also would have included his later film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets" title="Mean Streets">Mean Streets</a></i>. Even in embryonic form, the "Scorsese style" was already evident: a feel for New York Italian American street-life, rapid editing, an eclectic rock soundtrack, and a troubled male protagonist.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From there he became friends with the influential "movie brats" of the 1970s: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. It was Brian De Palma who introduced Scorsese to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>. During this period he worked as the assistant director and one of the editors on the documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock_(film)" title="Woodstock (film)">Woodstock</a></i> and met actor-director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes" title="John Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a>, who would also go on to become a close friend and mentor.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972 Scorsese made the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Depression</a>-era exploiter <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcar_Bertha" title="Boxcar Bertha">Boxcar Bertha</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-movie" title="B-movie">B-movie</a> producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman" title="Roger Corman">Roger Corman</a>, who had also helped directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sayles" title="John Sayles">John Sayles</a> launch their careers. It was Corman who taught Scorsese that entertaining films could be shot with next to no money or time, preparing the young director well for the challenges to come with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_Streets" title="Mean Streets">Mean Streets</a></i>. Following the film's release, Cassavetes encouraged Scorsese to make the films that he wanted to make, rather than someone else's projects.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Championed by influential movie critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a>, <i>Mean Streets</i> was a breakthrough for Scorsese, De Niro, and Keitel. By now the signature Scorsese style was in place: macho posturing, bloody violence, Catholic guilt and redemption, gritty New York locale (though the majority of <i>Mean Streets</i> was actually shot in Los Angeles), rapid-fire editing, and a rock soundtrack. Although the film was innovative, its wired atmosphere, edgy documentary style, and gritty street-level direction owed a debt to directors Cassavetes, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Fuller" title="Samuel Fuller">Samuel Fuller</a>, and early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>. (Indeed the film was completed with much encouragement from Cassavetes, who felt <i>Boxcar Bertha</i> was undeserving of the young director's prodigious talent.)</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1974, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Burstyn" title="Ellen Burstyn">Ellen Burstyn</a> chose Scorsese to direct her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Doesn%27t_Live_Here_Anymore" title="Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore">Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore</a></i>, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. Although well regarded, the film remains an anomaly in the director's early career, as it focuses on a central female character. Returning to Little Italy to explore his ethnic roots, Scorsese next came up with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italianamerican" title="Italianamerican">Italianamerican</a>, a documentary featuring his parents, Charles and Catherine Scorsese.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The iconic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver" title="Taxi Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i> followed in 1976 â€“ Scorsese's dark, urban nightmare of one lonely man's slow, deliberate descent into insanity.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film established Scorsese as an accomplished filmmaker operating on a highly skilled level, and also brought attention to cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chapman_(cinematographer)" title="Michael Chapman (cinematographer)">Michael Chapman</a>, whose style tends towards high contrasts, strong colors and complex camera movements. The groundbreaking performance of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a> as the troubled and psychotic Travis Bickle was highly regarded. The film co-starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Foster" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> in a highly controversial role as an underage prostitute, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" title="Harvey Keitel">Harvey Keitel</a> as her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimp" title="Pimp">pimp</a>, Matthew a.k.a. "Sport."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Taxi Driver</i> also marked the start of a series of collaborations between Scorsese and writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>, whose influences included the diary of would-be assassin <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Bremer" title="Arthur Bremer">Arthur Bremer</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickpocket_(film)" title="Pickpocket (film)">Pickpocket</a></i> a film by the French director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bresson" title="Robert Bresson">Robert Bresson</a>. Writer/director Schrader often returns to Bresson's work in films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Gigolo" title="American Gigolo">American Gigolo</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Sleeper" title="Light Sleeper">Light Sleeper</a></i>, and Scorsese's later <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bringing_Out_the_Dead" title="Bringing Out the Dead">Bringing Out the Dead</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Already controversial upon its release, <i>Taxi Driver</i> hit the headlines again five years later, when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley,_Jr" title="John Hinckley, Jr">John Hinckley, Jr</a>., made an assassination attempt on then-President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. He subsequently blamed his act on his obsession with Jodie Foster's <i>Taxi Driver</i> character (in the film, De Niro's character, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Bickle" title="Travis Bickle">Travis Bickle</a>, makes an assassination attempt on a senator).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Taxi Driver</i> won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, also receiving four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_award" title="Academy award">Oscar</a> nominations, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, although all were unsuccessful.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The critical success of <i>Taxi Driver</i> encouraged Scorsese to move ahead with his first big-budget project: the highly stylized musical <i>New York, New York</i>.

Thematically too, the concerns carried on from <i>Mean Streets</i> and <i>Taxi Driver</i>: insecure males, violence, guilt, and redemption.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the screenplay for <i>Raging Bull</i> was credited to Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin (who earlier co-wrote <i>Mean Streets</i>), the finished script differed extensively from Schrader's original draft.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese's next project was his fifth collaboration with Robert De Niro, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_of_Comedy_(1983_film)" title="The King of Comedy (1983 film)">The King of Comedy</a></i> (1983). A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satire</a> on the world of media and celebrity, it was an obvious departure from the more emotionally committed films he had become associated with. Visually, it was far less kinetic than the style Scorsese had developed up until this point, often using a static camera and long takes.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1983 Scorsese began work on a long-cherished personal project, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)" title="The Last Temptation of Christ (film)">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></i>, based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1951_in_literature" title="1951 in literature">1951</a> (English translation 1960) novel written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis" title="Nikos Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>, who was introduced to the director by actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Hershey" title="Barbara Hershey">Barbara Hershey</a> when they were both attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a> in the late 1960s.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the collapse of this project Scorsese again saw his career at a critical point, as he described in the documentary <i>Filming for Your Life: Making 'After Hours'</i> (2004). He saw that in the increasingly commercial world of 1980s Hollywood, the highly stylized and personal 1970s films he and others had built their careers on would not continue to enjoy the same status. Scorsese decided then on an almost totally new approach to his work. With <i>After Hours</i> (1985) he made an aesthetic shift back to a pared-down, almost "underground" film-making style â€” his way of staying viable. Filmed on an extremely low budget, on location, and at night in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoHo" title="SoHo">SoHo</a> neighborhood of Manhattan, the film is a black comedy about one increasingly misfortunate night for a mild New York word processor (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin_Dunne" title="Griffin Dunne">Griffin Dunne</a>) and featured cameos by such disparate actors as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teri_Garr" title="Teri Garr">Teri Garr</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheech_and_Chong" title="Cheech and Chong">Cheech and Chong</a>. A bit of a stylistic anomaly for Scorsese, <i>After Hours</i> fits in well with popular low-budget "cult" films of the 1980s, e.g. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme" title="Jonathan Demme">Jonathan Demme</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Wild_(1986_film)" title="Something Wild (1986 film)">Something Wild</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Cox" title="Alex Cox">Alex Cox</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_Man_(film)" title="Repo Man (film)">Repo Man</a></i>.</p>

Although typically visually assured, <i>The Color of Money</i> was the director's first foray into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainstream" title="Mainstream">mainstream</a> commercial film-making. It won actor Paul Newman a belated Oscar and gave Scorsese the clout to finally secure backing for a project that had been a long time goal for him: <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>. He also made a brief venture into television, directing an episode of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazing_Stories_(TV_series)" title="Amazing Stories (TV series)">Amazing Stories</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his mid-80s flirtation with commercial Hollywood, Scorsese made a major return to personal film-making with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>-scripted <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> in 1988. Based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikos_Kazantzakis" title="Nikos Kazantzakis">Nikos Kazantzakis</a>'s controversial 1960 book, it retold the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ" title="Christ">Christ</a> in human rather than divine terms. Even prior to its release the film caused a massive furor, worldwide protests against its perceived <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy" title="Blasphemy">blasphemy</a> effectively turning a low budget independent movie into a media sensation. Most controversy centered on the final passages of the film which depicted Christ marrying and raising a family with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Magdalene" title="Mary Magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satan" title="Satan">Satan</a>-induced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination" title="Hallucination">hallucination</a> while on the cross.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Looking past the controversy, <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> gained critical acclaim and remains an important work in Scorsese's canon: an explicit attempt to wrestle with the spirituality which had under-pinned his films up until that point. The director went on to receive his second nomination for a Best Director Academy Award (again unsuccessfully, this time losing to Barry Levinson for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_Man" title="Rain Man">Rain Man</a></i>).</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a decade of mostly mixed results, gangster epic <i>Goodfellas</i> (1990) was a return to form for Scorsese and his most confident and fully realized film since <i>Raging Bull</i>. A return to Little Italy, De Niro, and Joe Pesci, <i>Goodfellas</i> offered a virtuoso display of the director's bravura cinematic technique and re-established, enhanced, and consolidated his reputation. The film is widely considered one of the director's greatest achievements.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, <i>Goodfellas</i> also signified an important shift in tone in the director's work, inaugurating an era in his career which was technically accomplished but some have argued emotionally detached. Despite this, many view <i>Goodfellas</i> as a Scorsese <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype" title="Archetype">archetype</a> â€” the apogee of his cinematic technique.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese earned his third Best Director nomination for <i>Goodfellas</i> but again lost to a first-time director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_with_Wolves" title="Dances with Wolves">Dances with Wolves</a></i>). The film also earned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a> an Academy Award (Best Supporting Actor).</p>

Another foray into the mainstream, the film was a stylized <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Guignol" title="Grand Guignol">Grand Guignol</a> thriller taking its cues heavily from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_Hunter_(film)" title="The Night of the Hunter (film)">The Night of the Hunter</a></i> (1955). <i>Cape Fear</i> received a mixed critical reception and was lambasted in many quarters for its scenes depicting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogynistic" title="Misogynistic">misogynistic</a> violence. However, the lurid subject matter did give Scorsese a chance to experiment with a dazzling array of visual tricks and effects. The film garnered two Oscar nominations. Earning eighty million dollars domestically, it would stand as Scorsese's most commercially successful release until <i>The Aviator</i> (2004), and then <i>The Departed</i> (2006). The film also marked the first time Scorsese used wide-screen Panavision with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The opulent and handsomely mounted <i>The Age of Innocence</i> (1993) was on the surface a huge departure for Scorsese, a period adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about the constrictive high society of late-19th Century New York. It was highly lauded by critics upon original release, but was a box office bomb. As noted in <i>Scorsese on Scorsese</i> by editor/interviewer Ian Christie, the news that Scorsese wanted to make a film about a 19th Century failed romance raised many eyebrows among the film fraternity all the more when Scorsese made it clear that it was a personal project and not a studio for-hire job.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese was interested in doing a "romantic piece". His friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Cocks" title="Jay Cocks">Jay Cocks</a> gave him the Wharton novel in 1980, suggesting that this should be the romantic piece Scorsese should film as Cocks felt it best represented his sensibility. In <i>Scorsese on Scorsese</i> he noted that:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese who was strongly drawn to the characters and the story of Wharton's text, wanted his film to be as rich an emotional experience as the book was to him rather than the traditional academic adaptations of literary works. To this aim, Scorsese sought influence from diverse period films which made an emotional impact on him. In <i>Scorsese on Scorsese</i>, he documents influences from films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti" title="Luchino Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senso_(film)" title="Senso (film)">Senso</a></i> and his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_Gattopardo_(film)" title="Il Gattopardo (film)">Il Gattopardo</a></i> as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_(film)" title="The Magnificent Ambersons (film)">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i> and also <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Rossellini" title="Roberto Rossellini">Roberto Rossellini</a>'s <i>La Prise de Pouvoir par Louis XIV</i>. Although <i>The Age of Innocence</i> was ultimately different than these films in terms of narrative, story and thematic concern, the presence of a lost society, of lost values as well as detailed re-creations of social customs and rituals continues the tradition of these films.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recently, it has started to come back into the public eye, especially in countries such as the UK and France, but still is largely neglected in North America. The film earned five Academy Award nominations (including for Scorsese for Best Adapted Screenplay), winning the Costume Design Oscar. It also made a significant impact on directors such as Chinese auteur <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian_Zhuangzhuang" title="Tian Zhuangzhuang">Tian Zhuangzhuang</a>, and British film-maker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Davies" title="Terence Davies">Terence Davies</a> both of whom ranked it among their ten favorite films.</p>

The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Critically, however, <i>Casino</i> received mixed notices. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier <i>Goodfellas</i>. Indeed many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again being an unbridled psychopath. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone" title="Sharon Stone">Sharon Stone</a> was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress Academy Award</a> for her performance.</p>

Not least a departure in subject matter, <i>Kundun</i> also saw Scorsese employing a fresh narrative and visual approach. Traditional dramatic devices were substituted for a trance-like meditation achieved through an elaborate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableau_vivant" title="Tableau vivant">tableau</a> of colourful visual images.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a source of turmoil for its distributor, Disney, who were planning significant expansion into the Chinese market at the time. Initially defiant in the face of pressure from Chinese officials, Disney has since distanced itself from the project, hurting <i>Kundun'</i>s commercial profile.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the short term, the sheer eclecticism in evidence enhanced the director's reputation. In the long term however, it generally appears <i>Kundun</i> has been sidelined in most critical appraisals of the director, mostly noted as a stylistic and thematic detour. <i>Kundun</i> was the director's second attempt to profile the life of a great religious leader, following <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Bringing Out the Dead</i> (1999) was a return to familiar territory, with the director and writer Paul Schrader constructing a pitch-black comic take on their own earlier <i>Taxi Driver</i>. Like previous Scorsese-Schrader collaborations, its final scenes of spiritual redemption explicitly recalled the films of Robert Bresson. (It's also worth noting that the film's incident-filled nocturnal setting is reminiscent of <i>After Hours</i>.) It received generally positive reviews, although not the universal critical acclaim of some of his other films. It stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ving_Rhames" title="Ving Rhames">Ving Rhames</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goodman" title="John Goodman">John Goodman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Sizemore" title="Tom Sizemore">Tom Sizemore</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Arquette" title="Patricia Arquette">Patricia Arquette</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999 Scorsese also produced a documentary on Italian filmmakers entitled <i>Il Mio Viaggio in Italia</i>, also known as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Voyage_to_Italy" title="My Voyage to Italy">My Voyage to Italy</a></i>. The documentary foreshadowed the director's next project, the epic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangs_of_New_York" title="Gangs of New York">Gangs of New York</a></i> (2002), influenced by (amongst many others) major Italian directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti" title="Luchino Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a> and filmed in its entirety at Rome's famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinecitt%C3%A0" title="CinecittÃ ">CinecittÃ </a> film studios.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With a production budget said to be in excess of $100 million, <i>Gangs of New York</i> was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like <i>The Age of Innocence</i>, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing on the other end of the social scale (and like that film, also starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The production was highly troubled with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax" title="Miramax">Miramax</a> boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein" title="Harvey Weinstein">Harvey Weinstein</a>. Despite denials of artistic compromise, <i>Gangs of New York</i> revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes which the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposition_(literary_technique)" title="Exposition (literary technique)">exposition</a> purposes and explanatory <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(literary_technique)" title="Flashback (literary technique)">flashbacks</a>, here surfaced in abundance. The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Bernstein" title="Elmer Bernstein">Elmer Bernstein</a> was rejected at a late stage for a score by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Shore" title="Howard Shore">Howard Shore</a> and mainstream rock artists <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U2" title="U2">U2</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Gabriel" title="Peter Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>. The final cut of the movie ran to 168 minutes, while the director's original cut was over 180 minutes in length. The film still received generally positive reviews with the review tallying website <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reporting that 75% of the reviews they tallied for the film were positive and summarizing the critics by saying "Though flawed, the sprawling, messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis's electrifying performance."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Originally filmed for a release in the winter of 2001 (to qualify for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nominations), Scorsese delayed the final production of the film until after the beginning of 2002; the studio consequently delayed the film for nearly a year until its release in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_season" title="Oscar season">Oscar season</a> of late 2002.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Gangs of New York</i> earned Scorsese his first Golden Globe for Best Director. In February 2003, <i>Gangs of New York</i> received ten <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a>, however it did not win in any category.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese also had uncredited involvement as executive producer with the 2002 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuces_Wild" title="Deuces Wild">Deuces Wild</a></i>, written by Paul Kimatian.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year Scorsese completed production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blues_(film)" title="The Blues (film)">The Blues</a></i>, an expansive seven part documentary tracing the history of blues music from its African roots to the Mississippi Delta and beyond.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese's film <i>The Aviator</i> (2004), was a lavish, large-scale <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopic" title="Biopic">biopic</a> of eccentric aviation pioneer and film mogul <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> and would reunite Scorsese with actor Leonardo DiCaprio.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Aviator</i> was nominated for six Golden Globe awards, including <i>Best Picture â€“ Drama</i>, <i>Best Director</i>, <i>Best Screenplay</i>, and <i>Best Actor â€“ Drama</i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. It won three, including <i>Best Picture and Best Actor- Drama</i>.

Simultaneously, the police assign undercover cop Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) to infiltrate Costello's crew. When both sides realize the situation, each man attempts to discover the other's true identity before their cover is blown.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a young age, Colin Sullivan (Damon) is introduced to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a> through Irish mobster Frank Costello (Nicholson) in the Irish neighborhood of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Boston" title="South Boston">Southie</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a>. Costello trains him to become his mole inside the Massachusetts State Police. Sullivan is accepted into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Investigations_Unit" title="Special Investigations Unit">Special Investigations Unit</a> (SIU), which focuses on organized crime. Before he graduates from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_academy" title="Police academy">police academy</a>, Billy Costigan (DiCaprio) is asked by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg) to become an undercover agent, as his childhood and family ties to organized crime make him a perfect infiltrator. He drops out of the academy and does time in prison on a fake assault charge to increase his credibility.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As both infiltrate their respective organizations, Sullivan begins a romance with psychiatrist Madolyn Madden (Farmiga). Costigan sees her for his probation and also develops a relationship with her. Shortly after, Costigan makes love to her before she moves in with Sullivan. After Costello barely escapes a sting operation, both moles become aware of the other's existence (though not his identity). Sullivan is told to find the "rat" and asks Costello for his crew's information to determine who is the informer within Costello's crew. Costigan follows Costello into a movie theater where Costello gives Sullivan an envelope with the details. Costigan then chases Sullivan through Boston's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown,_Boston" title="Chinatown, Boston">Chinatown</a>, during which Sullivan pulls out a pocket knife and stabs an innocent bystander in the stomach. When it is over, both men still do not know each other's identity. Sullivan then has Queenan tailed as he meets Costigan in an abandoned building. Sullivan sends Costello's men in and Queenan distracts them to let Costigan escape. He is thrown from the roof and dies at the feet of Costigan, who is covered in some of Queenan's blood. When the mobsters escape, Costigan pretends he has come to rejoin them. The trailing state troopers open fire on Costello's crew, which causes casualties on both sides. Later, at one of Costello's safe houses, Delahunt (one of Costello's enforcers) tells Costigan "I gave you the wrong address--but you went to the right one" but then asks him if he knows why he didn't say anything about before dying. When Costello's henchman, Fitzgibbons, known as "Fitzy," (O'Hara) does an unsuccessful job of hiding Delahunt's corpse, it's revealed that Delahunt was also an undercover cop with the Boston PD. Costello says, "They're saying he's a cop so I won't look for the cop."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now under scrutiny, Sullivan is attacked by a suspicious Dignam because of Queenan's death. Captain George Ellerby (Baldwin) places Dignam on leave. Using Queenan's bloody phone, Sullivan reaches Costigan, who refuses to abort his mission. Sullivan learns of Costello's role as an informant for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> from Queenan's diary, causing him to worry about his dual identity being revealed. With Costigan's help, Costello is tracked to a cocaine drop-off, where he and his crew become trapped in a gunfight with police, resulting in most of the mobsters being killed. As Costello attempts an escape he is confronted by Sullivan. Costello admits he is an occasional FBI mole and tries to shoot, but Sullivan fires first fatally hitting him, then when Costello tries to shoot him again Sullivan shoots him multiple times, killing him. With Costello dead, Sullivan is applauded the next day by everyone on the force. In good faith, Costigan comes to him for restoration of his true identity, but notices an envelope containing details of Costello's men on Sullivan's desk and flees. Knowing he has been found out, Sullivan erases all records of Costigan from the police computer system.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Costigan's funeral, Sullivan and Madolyn stand at the grave. She is clearly distraught. Sullivan attempts to discuss the future of her child, but she ignores him. Later, Sullivan enters his apartment with groceries, and to his surprise finds Dignam waiting for him, wearing hospital footies and surgical gloves to leave no trace of his presence and aiming a silenced pistol straight at him. Aware of Sullivan's treachery, Dignam shoots him in the temple. As Sullivan collapses dead, Dignam calmly exits Sullivan's apartment.
