The story, which focused on an unhinged, out-of-work actor, had been written with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> in mind. After he turned it down, Goldberg expressed a strong interest, but when production began Torn reportedly had to contend with Goldberg constantly digressing and improvising, and he had to plead with her to perform takes that stuck to the script.

They divorced and he later married the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a>-winning actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldine_Page" title="Geraldine Page">Geraldine Page</a>. Page and Torn remained married until her death in 1987. They had three children: Tony Torn, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jon_Torn&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jon Torn (page does not exist)">Jon Torn</a>, an Electronic Media and Film teacher at Northern Arizona University, and actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelica_Torn" title="Angelica Torn">Angelica Torn</a>. Torn apparently delighted in the fact that their country estate was called Torn Page. He is married to actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Wright" title="Amy Wright">Amy Wright</a> with whom he has two children, Katie and Claire. Katie  is an accomplished painter and video artist.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 2004, Torn was arrested in New York City after his car collided with a taxi. A video of his arrest in which he curses at officers and angrily refuses a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathalyzer" title="Breathalyzer">breathalyzer</a> test was aired on television news outlets. In October 2004, a jury acquitted Torn of any wrongdoing. In December 2006, Torn was again arrested for drunk driving in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Salem,_New_York" title="North Salem, New York">North Salem, New York</a>, after colliding with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractor_trailer" title="Tractor trailer">tractor trailer</a>. In April 2007, Torn pleaded guilty and had his drivers license suspended for 90 days and was required to pay a $380 fine.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On December 14, 2008, Torn was again arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. A bartender at the White Hart Inn in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury,_Connecticut" title="Salisbury, Connecticut">Salisbury</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, reportedly served Torn, but apparently noticed he appeared intoxicated as he was leaving the establishment, according to a police report. Torn reportedly refused a ride home and got into his vehicle with a Christmas tree tied on top and drove away. He was convicted and sentenced to probation in May 2009.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On January 29, 2010, Torn was arrested after breaking into a closed Litchfield Bancorp branch office in Lakeville, Connecticut; Torn maintains a residence in the town. He was charged with carrying a firearm without a permit, carrying a firearm while intoxicated, first-degree burglary, second-degree criminal trespassing and third-degree criminal mischief. Connecticut State Police said that Torn broke into the bank thinking it was his home.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On August 11, 2010, Torn was denied special probation which would have allowed his name to be cleared of charges. The judge in the case cited Torn's history of alcohol abuse, and the possession of a loaded weapon while intoxicated, which carries a minimum one-year sentence.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maidstone_(film)" title="Maidstone (film)">Maidstone</a></i> (1970), Torn, apparently unhappy with the film, struck director and star of the film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Mailer" title="Norman Mailer">Norman Mailer</a> in the head with a hammer. With the camera rolling, Mailer bit Torn's ear and they wrestled to the ground. The fight continued until it was broken up by cast and crew members as Mailer's children screamed in the background. The fight is featured in the film. Although the scene may have been planned by Torn, the blood shed by both actors is real, and Torn was reportedly truly outraged by Mailer's direction.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999, Torn filed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation" title="Defamation">defamation</a> lawsuit against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a> over a story Hopper told on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno_(1992_TV_series)" title="The Tonight Show with Jay Leno (1992 TV series)">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></i>. Hopper claimed that Torn pulled a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife" title="Knife">knife</a> on him during pre-production of the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider" title="Easy Rider">Easy Rider</a></i> (1969). According to Hopper, Torn was originally cast in the film but was replaced with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> after the incident. According to Torn's suit, it was actually Hopper who pulled the knife on him. A judge ruled in Torn's favor and Hopper was ordered to pay $475,000 in damages. Hopper then <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal" title="Appeal">appealed</a> but the judge again ruled in Torn's favor and Hopper was required to pay another $475,000 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punitive_damages" title="Punitive damages">punitive damages</a>.</p>

Despite Baskin's (and her own) doubts, she stays and begins to fix up the property.</p>
