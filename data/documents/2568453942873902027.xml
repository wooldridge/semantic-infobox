U.S. domestic box office totals for his films exceed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>3.9Â billion. He is the father of actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Hanks" title="Colin Hanks">Colin Hanks</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hanks was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_California" title="Concord, California">Concord</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. His father, Amos Mefford Hanks (born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_County,_California" title="Glenn County, California">Glenn County, California</a>, on March 9, 1924Â â€“ died in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda,_California" title="Alameda, California">Alameda, California</a>, on January 31, 1992), was a distant relative of President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, through Lincoln's mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Hanks" title="Nancy Hanks">Nancy Hanks</a>. His mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese-American" title="Portuguese-American">Portuguese-American</a> Janet Marylyn (nÃ©e Frager; born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_County,_California" title="Alameda County, California">Alameda County, California</a>, on January 18, 1932), was a hospital worker. Hanks's parents divorced in 1960. The family's three oldest children, Sandra (now Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer" title="Writer">writer</a>), Larry (now Lawrence M. Hanks, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ph.D." title="Ph.D.">Ph.D.</a>, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomology" title="Entomology">entomology</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor" title="Professor">professor</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana-Champaign" title="University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign">University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</a>) and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Hanks" title="Jim Hanks">Jim</a>, now an actor and film maker, remained with his mother in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bluff,_California" title="Red Bluff, California">Red Bluff, California</a>. Afterwards, both parents remarried. Hanks's first stepmother came to the marriage with five children of her own. Hanks once told <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i>: "Everybody in my family likes each other. But there were always about 50 people at the house. I didn't exactly feel like an outsider, but I was sort of outside it." That marriage ended in divorce after two years.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Amos Hanks became a single parent, working long hours and often leaving the children to fend for themselves, an exercise in self-reliance that served the siblings well. In addition to having a family history of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism" title="Catholicism">Catholicism</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism" title="Mormonism">Mormonism</a>, Hanks was a "Bible-toting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evangelical" title="Evangelical">evangelical</a> teenager" for several years. In school, Hanks was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling <i>Rolling Stone</i> magazine: "I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible." In 1965, Amos Hanks married Frances Wong, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> native of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_American" title="Chinese American">Chinese</a> descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Tom during his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school" title="High school">high school</a> years. Tom acted in school plays, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pacific_(musical)" title="South Pacific (musical)">South Pacific</a></i>, while attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skyline_High_School_(Oakland,_California)" title="Skyline High School (Oakland, California)">Skyline High School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hanks studied theater at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chabot_College" title="Chabot College">Chabot College</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayward,_California" title="Hayward, California">Hayward, California</a>, and after two years, transferred to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Sacramento" title="California State University, Sacramento">California State University, Sacramento</a>. Hanks told <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>: "Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat, and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" title="Bertolt Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Williams" title="Tennessee Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>, and all that, and now look at me, acting is my job. I wouldn't have it any other way."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his years studying theater, Hanks met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Dowling" title="Vincent Dowling">Vincent Dowling</a>, head of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Lakes_Theater_Festival" title="Great Lakes Theater Festival">Great Lakes Theater Festival</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland,_Ohio" title="Cleveland, Ohio">Cleveland</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>. At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the Festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, all of which caused Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proteus" title="Proteus">Proteus</a> in Shakespeare's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona" title="The Two Gentlemen of Verona">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></i>, one of the few times he played a villain.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1979, Hanks packed his bags for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Knows_You%27re_Alone" title="He Knows You're Alone">He Knows You're Alone</a></i> and got a part in the television movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazes_and_Monsters" title="Mazes and Monsters">Mazes and Monsters</a></i>. Early in 1979, Hanks was cast in the lead role of Callimaco in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Shakespeare_Company" title="Riverside Shakespeare Company">Riverside Shakespeare Company</a>'s production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Machiavelli" title="NiccolÃ² Machiavelli">NiccolÃ² Machiavelli</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mandrake" title="The Mandrake">The Mandrake</a></i>, directed by Daniel Southern. This remains Hanks's only New York stage performance to date; as a high profile <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_Off_Broadway" title="Off Off Broadway">Off Off Broadway</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showcase" title="Showcase">showcase</a>, the production helped Tom land an agent, Joe Ohla with the J. Michael Bloom Agency. The next year Hanks landed a lead role on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> television pilot of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosom_Buddies" title="Bosom Buddies">Bosom Buddies</a></i>, playing the role of Kip Wilson. Hanks moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, where he and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Scolari" title="Peter Scolari">Peter Scolari</a> played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari in the 1970s game show <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_Me_Laugh" title="Make Me Laugh">Make Me Laugh</a></i>. <i>Bosom Buddies</i> ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. "The first day I saw him on the set," co-producer Ian Praiser told <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i>, "I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years." But if Praiser knew it, he was not able to convince Hanks. "The television show had come out of nowhere," best friend Tom Lizzio told <i>Rolling Stone</i>. "Then out of nowhere it got canceled. He figured he'd be back to pulling ropes and hanging lights in a theater."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Bosom Buddies</i> and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a></i> ("A Case of Revenge," where he played a disgruntled former classmate of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fonzie" title="Fonzie">The Fonz</a>) prompted director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Howard" title="Ron Howard">Ron Howard</a> to contact Hanks. Howard was working on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splash_(film)" title="Splash (film)">Splash</a></i> (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaid</a> who falls in love with a human. At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Candy" title="John Candy">John Candy</a>. Instead, Hanks got the lead role and a career boost from <i>Splash</i>, which went on to become a box office hit, grossing more than US$69Â million. He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_Party_(film)" title="Bachelor Party (film)">Bachelor Party</a></i>, also in 1984.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1983â€“84, Hanks made three guest appearances on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Ties" title="Family Ties">Family Ties</a></i> as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother, Ned Donnelly.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Period_of_successes_and_failures">Period of successes and failures</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Common" title="Nothing in Common">Nothing in Common</a></i> (1986)Â â€“ about a young man alienated from his parents who must re-establish a relationship with his father, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a>Â â€“ Hanks began to establish the credentials of not only a comic actor but of someone who could carry a serious role. "It changed my desires about working in movies," Hanks told <i>Rolling Stone</i>. "Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Money_Pit" title="The Money Pit">The Money Pit</a></i>, where the story is really about a guy and his house."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a few more flops and a moderate success with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragnet_(1987_film)" title="Dragnet (1987 film)">Dragnet</a></i>, Hanks succeeded with the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big" title="Big">Big</a></i> (1988), both at the box office and within the industry. The film established Hanks as a major <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> talent. It was followed later that year by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punchline_(film)" title="Punchline (film)">Punchline</a></i>, in which he and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field" title="Sally Field">Sally Field</a> co-star as struggling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedian" title="Stand-up comedian">stand-up comedians</a>. Hanks's character, Steven Gold, a failing medical student trying to break into stand-up, was somewhat edgy and complex. Hanks' portrayal of Gold offered a glimpse of the far more dramatic roles Hanks would master in films to come. Hanks then suffered a pile of box-office failures: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_%27Burbs" title="The 'Burbs">The 'Burbs</a></i> (1989), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Versus_the_Volcano" title="Joe Versus the Volcano">Joe Versus the Volcano</a></i> (1990), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bonfire_of_the_Vanities_(film)" title="The Bonfire of the Vanities (film)">The Bonfire of the Vanities</a></i> (1990), as a greedy <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street" title="Wall Street">Wall Street</a> type who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. Only the 1989 movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_and_Hooch" title="Turner and Hooch">Turner and Hooch</a></i> brought success for Hanks during this time. In a 1993 issue of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Adventures" title="Disney Adventures">Disney Adventures</a></i>, Hanks said, "I saw <i>Turner and Hooch</i> the other day in the SAC store and couldn't help but be reminiscent. I cried like a baby." He did admit to making a couple of "bum tickers," however, and blamed his "...deductive reasoning and decision making skills."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Progression_into_dramatic_roles">Progression into dramatic roles</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball" title="Baseball">baseball</a> star turned manager in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_League_of_Their_Own" title="A League of Their Own">A League of Their Own</a></i> (1992). Hanks admits that his acting in earlier roles was not great and that he has improved. In an interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i>, Hanks noted his <i>"modern era of moviemaking ... because enough self-discovery has gone on.... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top"</i>. This "modern era" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepless_in_Seattle" title="Sleepless in Seattle">Sleepless in Seattle</a></i> and then with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_(film)" title="Philadelphia (film)">Philadelphia</a></i>. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the airwaves. Richard Schickel of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> called his performance "charming," and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premiere romantic-comedy stars of his generation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Philadelphia</i>, he played a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality" title="Homosexuality">gay</a> lawyer with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" title="AIDS">AIDS</a> who sues his firm for discrimination. Hanks lost thirty-five pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_(magazine)" title="People (magazine)">People</a></i>, Leah Rozen stated "Above all, credit for <i>Philadelphia'</i>s success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar." Hanks won the 1993 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for Best Actor for his role in <i>Philadelphia</i>. During his acceptance speech he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay. The revelation inspired the 1997 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_%26_Out" title="In &amp; Out">In &amp; Out</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kline" title="Kevin Kline">Kevin Kline</a> as an English Literature teacher who is outed by a former student in a similar way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hanks followed <i>Philadelphia</i> with the 1994 summer hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump_(film)" title="Forrest Gump (film)">Forrest Gump</a></i>. Of the film, Hanks has remarked: "When I read the script for <i>Gump</i>, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do." Hanks won his second Best Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for his role in <i>Forrest Gump</i>, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.

On another episode, O'Brien, noting that Hanks was missing Christmas on his promotional tour, brought the season to him, including a gift (the skeleton of Hooch), and a mass of snow burying them both. On yet another episode, Conan gave Hanks a painting he had commissioned reflecting two of his interests: Astronauts landing on the beach at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_Landings" title="Normandy Landings">Normandy</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rodat first came up with the film's story in 1994 when he saw a monument dedicated to four sons of Agnes Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania.

The scene then cuts to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy" title="Invasion of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a>, with American soldiers preparing for the perils of landing on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach" title="Omaha Beach">Omaha Beach</a> and struggling against dug-in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heer_(1935-1945)" title="Heer (1935-1945)">German</a> infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire, which cut down many of the men. Captain John H.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scene then shifts to the United States where General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall" title="George Marshall">George Marshall</a> is informed that three of four brothers in the Ryan family have all died within days of each other and that their mother will receive all three notices on the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan of Baker Company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/506th_Infantry_Regiment" title="506th Infantry Regiment">506th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division" title="101st Airborne Division">101st Airborne Division</a> is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">missing in action</a> somewhere in Normandy.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in France, three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan. He assembles six Rangers from his company, plus one Corporal Upham detailed from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="29th Infantry Division (United States)">29th Infantry Division</a>, who speaks fluent French and German, to accomplish the task. With no information about Ryan's whereabouts, Miller and his men move out to Neuville. On the outskirts of Neuville they meet a platoon from the 101st. After entering the town, Private Caparzo is fatally wounded by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper" title="Sniper">sniper</a>, who is in turn shot and killed by Private Jackson. They locate a Private James Fredrick Ryan from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> but soon realize their mistake. They find a member of Charlie Company, 506th, who informs them that his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_zone" title="Drop zone">drop zone</a> was at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierville,_Manche" title="Vierville, Manche">Vierville</a> and that Baker and Charlie companies had the same rally point. Once they reach the rally point, Miller locates a friend of Ryan's, who reveals that Ryan is defending a strategically-important bridge over the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merderet" title="Merderet">Merderet River</a> in the fictional town of Ramelle.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the way to Ramelle, Miller decides to take the opportunity to neutralize a small German machine gun position close to an abandoned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> station, despite the misgivings of his men. Wade, their medic, is fatally wounded in the ensuing skirmish. The last surviving German, known only as "Steamboat Willie", incurs the wrath of all the squad members except Upham, who protests to Miller about letting the squad kill the German soldier. The German pleads for his life and Miller decides to let him walk away, blindfolded, and surrender himself to the next <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> patrol. Viewing Miller's decision as letting the enemy go free, and no longer confident in Miller's leadership, Private Reiben declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission, prompting a confrontation with Sergeant Horvath. The argument heats up, until Miller defuses the situation by revealing his pre-war occupation as an English teacher, a question upon which the squad had set up a betting pool. Reiben then reluctantly decides to stay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The squad finally arrives on the outskirts of Ramelle, where they help three paratroopers destroy a German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftrack" title="Halftrack">halftrack</a>. Among the paratroopers is Private Ryan. After entering Ramelle, Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, and their mission to bring him home, and that two lives had been lost in the quest to find him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not feel it is fair to go home, asking Miller to tell his mother "when you found me I was here, and I was with the only brothers I have left," looking at the small band whose duty it was to defend a bridge and destroy an approaching German mechanized unit. Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge, setting up a creative defense plan with what little manpower and resources available.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Germans arrive in force with more than 50 men supported by armor. In spite of inflicting heavy German casualties, most of the paratroopers, and Miller's squad (Jackson, Mellish and Horvath), are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Miller is shot and fatally wounded. Just before a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I" title="Tiger I">Tiger Tank</a> reaches the bridge, an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang" title="P-51 Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> flies over and destroys it, followed by more Mustangs and advancing American infantry and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_Sherman" title="M4 Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> tanks who rout the remaining Germans. Upham <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution" title="Summary execution">executes</a> "Steamboat Willie" upon finding him with a group of surrendering Germans. Ryan, Reiben, and Upham are the only survivors of the battle. Ryan is with Miller as he dies and says his last words, "James... earn this. Earn it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in the present, the elderly veteran is revealed to be Ryan at Miller's grave. He asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life and that he is a "good man," and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Miller and the others. He then salutes Miller's grave as the camera pans down the gravestones to a placid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States" title="Flag of the United States">American flag</a> and fades out as it shows the number of men who died during fighting in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord" title="Operation Overlord">Normandy</a>.</p>

Gordon shared the finished script with Hanks, who liked it and in turn passed it along to Spielberg to direct. A shooting date was set for June 27, 1997. Before filming began, several of the film's stars, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Burns" title="Edward Burns">Edward Burns</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Pepper" title="Barry Pepper">Barry Pepper</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin_Diesel" title="Vin Diesel">Vin Diesel</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg" title="Adam Goldberg">Adam Goldberg</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Ribisi" title="Giovanni Ribisi">Giovanni Ribisi</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hanks" title="Tom Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, endured ten days of "boot camp" training and work on the film set to prepare for their roles.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg had already demonstrated his interest in World War II themes with the films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_(film)" title="1941 (film)">1941</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film)" title="Empire of the Sun (film)">Empire of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_(franchise)" title="Indiana Jones (franchise)"><i>Indiana Jones</i> series</a>.

When asked about this by <i>American Cinematographer</i>, Spielberg said, "I think that World War II is the most significant event of the last 100 years; the fate of the Baby Boomers and even Generation X was linked to the outcome. Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air. For years now, I've been looking for the right World War II story to shoot, and when Robert Rodat wrote <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, I found it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_Landings" title="Normandy Landings">D-Day</a> scenes were shot in Ballinesker Beach, Curracloe Strand, Ballinesker, just east of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curracloe" title="Curracloe">Curracloe</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Wexford" title="County Wexford">Wexford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Ireland</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Saving Private Ryan</i> has been critically noted for its realistic portrayal of World War II combat. In particular, the initial 24-minute sequence depicting the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_Landings" title="Normandy Landings">Omaha landings</a> was voted the "best battle scene of all time" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire</a></i> magazine and was ranked number one on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a>'s</i> list of the "50 Greatest Movie Moments". The scene cost <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>12 million and involved up to 1,500 extras, some of whom were members of the Irish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Defence_Forces" title="Reserve Defence Forces">Reserve Defence Forces</a>. Members of local reenactment groups such as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_Group" title="Second Battle Group">Second Battle Group</a> were cast as extras to play German soldiers. In addition, twenty to thirty actual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation" title="Amputation">amputees</a> were used to portray US soldiers maimed during the landing. Spielberg did not <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard" title="Storyboard">storyboard</a> the sequence, as he wanted spontaneous reactions and for "the action to inspire me as to where to put the camera".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The landing craft used included twelve actual World War II examples. The film-makers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect of blood in the seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I" title="Tiger I">Tiger I</a> tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34" title="T-34">T-34 tanks</a>. The two vehicles described in the film as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer" title="Panzer">Panzers</a> were meant to portray <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marder_III" title="Marder III">Marder III</a> self-propelled guns. One was created for the film using the chassis of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a>-built <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_38(t)" title="Panzer 38(t)">Panzer 38(t)</a> tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically-modified Swedish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridsvagn_m/41" title="Stridsvagn m/41">SAV m/43</a> assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inevitably, some artistic license was taken by the filmmakers for the sake of drama. One of the most notable is the depiction of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_SS_Panzer_Division_Das_Reich" title="2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich">2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich</a>, as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, one hundred miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="101st Airborne Division (United States)">101st Airborne Division</a> but of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="82nd Airborne Division (United States)">82nd Airborne Division</a>, part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Boston" title="Mission Boston">Mission Boston</a>. Much has been said about various "tactical errors" made by both the German and American forces in the film's climactic battle. Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics and strict historical accuracy for dramatic effect.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To achieve a tone and quality that was true to the story as well as reflected the period in which it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography" title="Cinematography">cinematographer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Kami%C5%84ski" title="Janusz KamiÅ„ski">Janusz KamiÅ„ski</a>, saying, "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." KamiÅ„ski had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_bypass" title="Bleach bypass">bleach bypass</a>, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_disc_shutter" title="Rotary disc shutter">shutter</a> timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180 degree timing. KamiÅ„ski clarifies, "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Release">Release</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was distributed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> in North America and by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> internationally. As a result of Paramount's 2005 acquisition of DreamWorks, Paramount has gained North America distribution rights as well (though still through the DreamWorks division). <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> was a critical and commercial success and is credited with contributing to a resurgence in America's interest in World War II. Old and new films, video games, and novels about the war enjoyed renewed popularity after its release. The film's use of desaturated colors, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-held_camera" title="Hand-held camera">hand-held cameras</a>, and tight angles has profoundly influenced subsequent films and video games. <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> was released in 2,463 theatres on July 28, 1998, and grossed $30.5 million on its opening weekend. The film grossed $216.5 million in North America and $265.3 million on other territories, bringing its worldwide total to $481.8 million and making it the highest grossing domestic film of the year.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical reception for the film was generally positive, with much praise for the realistic battle scenes and the actors' performances, but earning some criticism for the script and for ignoring the contributions of several other countries to the D-Day landings in general and at Omaha Beach specifically. The most direct example of the latter is that during the actual landing the 2nd Rangers disembarked from British ships and were taken to Omaha Beach by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> landing craft (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Assault#1944" title="Landing Craft Assault">LCAs</a>).

This criticism was far from universal with other critics recognizing the director's intent to make an "American" film. The film was not released in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> after Spielberg refused to cut the violent scenes; however, the film was finally released there on DVD with an 18SG certificate much later in 2005. It currently scores 91% "Certified Fresh" on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and 90% on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, two film review aggregate sites.
