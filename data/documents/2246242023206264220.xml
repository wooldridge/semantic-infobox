In 1968 he moved to the United States, immediately cementing his burgeoning directing status with the 1968 groundbreaking Academy Award winning horror film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary%27s_Baby_(film)" title="Rosemary's Baby (film)">Rosemary's Baby</a></i>.</p>

Polanski's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tenant" title="The Tenant">The Tenant</a></i> (1976), was shot in France, and completed the "Apartment Trilogy", following <i>Repulsion</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, after a photo shoot in Los Angeles, Polanski was arrested for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse" title="Child sexual abuse">sexual abuse</a> of a 13 year old girl.

To avoid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)" title="Sentence (law)">sentencing</a>, Polanski fled to his home in London, and then moved on to France the following day. In September 2009, Polanski was arrested by Swiss police, at the request of U.S. authorities, when he traveled to receive a lifetime achievement award at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Film_Festival" title="Zurich Film Festival">Zurich Film Festival</a>. In October 2009, the U.S. requested his extradition; however, on July 12, 2010, the Swiss rejected that request and instead declared him a "free man" after releasing him from custody.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski continued to make films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pianist_(2002_film)" title="The Pianist (2002 film)">The Pianist</a></i> (2002), a World War II-set adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland" title="History of the Jews in Poland">Jewish-Polish</a> musician <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw_Szpilman" title="WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Szpilman">WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Szpilman</a>'s autobiography <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pianist_(memoir)" title="The Pianist (memoir)">of the same name</a>, which echoed some of Polanski's earlier life experiences.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski was born as Rajmund Roman Thierry PolaÅ„ski in Paris, France, the son of Bula (<i>nÃ©e</i> Katz-Przedborska) and Ryszard PolaÅ„ski (nÃ© Liebling), a painter and plastics manufacturer. His mother had a daughter, Annette, by her previous husband. Annette managed to survive Auschwitz, where her mother died, and left Poland forever for France. His father was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_Poland" title="History of the Jews in Poland">Jewish</a> and his Russian-born mother had been raised Roman Catholic. Ryszard Liebling had changed his surname to PolaÅ„ski in early 1932. The PolaÅ„ski family moved back to the Polish city of KrakÃ³w in 1936, and were living there when the World WarÂ II began with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland_(1939)" title="Invasion of Poland (1939)">invasion of Poland</a>. Neither of Roman Polanski's parents was religious. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Government" title="General Government">KrakÃ³w was soon occupied</a> by the German forces. Nazi racial and religious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Laws" title="Nuremberg Laws">purity laws</a> made the PolaÅ„skis targets of persecution and forced them into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w_Ghetto" title="KrakÃ³w Ghetto">KrakÃ³w Ghetto</a>, along with thousands of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_in_Poland" title="Holocaust in Poland">city's Jews</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His father survived the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauthausen-Gusen_concentration_camp" title="Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a> in Austria, but his mother perished at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz-Birkenau_concentration_camp" title="Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp">Auschwitz</a>. PolaÅ„ski himself escaped the KrakÃ³w Ghetto in 1943 and survived the war using the name Romek Wilk with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rescue_of_Jews_by_Poles_during_the_Holocaust" title="Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust">help of some Polish</a> Roman Catholic families. As a Jewish child in hiding, he behaved outwardly as a Roman Catholic, although he was never baptized as such. After the war he was reunited with his father and moved back to KrakÃ³w. Roman Polanski's father married Wanda ZajÄ…czkowska, but Roman disliked his stepmother, which further estranged father and son, who had never been able to establish an intimate relationship. Ryszard PolaÅ„ski died of cancer in 1984.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_School_in_%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA" title="National Film School in Å&#129;Ã³dÅº">National Film School in Å&#129;Ã³dÅº</a>, the third-largest city in Poland. In the 1950s Polanski took up acting, appearing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrzej_Wajda" title="Andrzej Wajda">Andrzej Wajda</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokolenie" title="Pokolenie">Pokolenie</a></i> (<i>A Generation</i>, 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaczarowany_rower" title="Zaczarowany rower">Zaczarowany rower</a></i> (<i>Enchanted Bicycle</i> or <i>Magical Bicycle</i>). Polanski's directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film <i>Rower</i> (<i>Bicycle</i>). <i>Rower</i> is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski. It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="KrakÃ³w">KrakÃ³w</a> felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bike, but instead beat him badly and stole his money. In real life the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski's skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults, which he had committed. Several other short films made during his study at Å&#129;Ã³dÅº gained him considerable recognition, particularly <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Men_and_a_Wardrobe" title="Two Men and a Wardrobe">Two Men and a Wardrobe</a></i> (1958) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Angels_Fall" title="When Angels Fall">When Angels Fall</a></i> (1959). He graduated in 1959.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski's first feature-length film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knife_in_the_Water_(film)" title="Knife in the Water (film)">Knife in the Water</a></i> (1962), was also the first significant Polish film after WWII that did not have a war theme. Scripted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Skolimowski" title="Jerzy Skolimowski">Jerzy Skolimowski</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakub_Goldberg" title="Jakub Goldberg">Jakub Goldberg</a> and Polanski, <i>Knife in the Water</i> is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. A dark and unsettling work, Polanski's debut feature subtly evinces a profound pessimism about human relationships with regard to the psychological dynamics and moral consequences of status envy and sexual jealousy. <i>Knife in the Water</i> was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film, 1963).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his reputation as a major Polish filmmaker, Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fat_and_the_Lean" title="The Fat and the Lean">The Fat and the Lean</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssaki" title="Ssaki">Mammals</a></i>. While in France, Polanski contributed one segment ("La riviÃ¨re de diamants") to the French-produced omnibus film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_plus_belles_escroqueries_du_monde" title="Les plus belles escroqueries du monde">Les plus belles escroqueries du monde</a></i> (English title: <i>The Beautiful Swindlers</i>) in 1964. However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s the French film industry was generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker whom they viewed as a cultural Pole and not a Frenchman.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Brach" title="GÃ©rard Brach">GÃ©rard Brach</a>, a frequent collaborator. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repulsion" title="Repulsion">Repulsion</a></i> (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young Belgian woman named Carol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Deneuve" title="Catherine Deneuve">Catherine Deneuve</a>), who is living in London with her older sister (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_Furneaux" title="Yvonne Furneaux">Yvonne Furneaux</a>). While working as a beautician's assistant at a salon, Carol is often disturbed by the physical decrepitude of her elderly clients, and throughout the course of the film, she becomes increasingly distressed by sexual advances from the men around her. Her sister departs for a holiday in Italy with a boyfriend, and Carol is left alone in their shared apartment flat. Carol's disordered mind finally breaks from reality as actual threats of domestic and sexual invasion blend into grotesque paranoid hallucinations, causing her to respond with desperate, deadly acts of violence. The film's themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist" title="Surrealist">surrealist</a> cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950sÂ â€“ particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Bu%C3%B1uel" title="Luis BuÃ±uel">Luis BuÃ±uel</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un_chien_Andalou" title="Un chien Andalou">Un chien Andalou</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau" title="Jean Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blood_of_a_Poet" title="The Blood of a Poet">The Blood of a Poet</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri-Georges_Clouzot" title="Henri-Georges Clouzot">Henri-Georges Clouzot</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Diaboliques_(film)" title="Les Diaboliques (film)">Diabolique</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i>.</p>

The general tone and the basic premise of the film owes a great deal to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Beckett" title="Samuel Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot" title="Waiting for Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></i>, along with aspects of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Pinter" title="Harold Pinter">Harold Pinter</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birthday_Party_(play)" title="The Birthday Party (play)">The Birthday Party</a></i>. Indeed, the original title for the film was <i>When Katelbach Comes</i> (named after the actor AndrÃ© Katelbach, who played the role of the master in Polanski's very Beckettian 1961 short film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fat_and_the_Lean" title="The Fat and the Lean">The Fat and the Lean</a></i>), and among the cast was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_MacGowran" title="Jack MacGowran">Jack MacGowran</a>, a veteran of Beckett's stage and television work. The film's setup concerns two gangsters, Dickie and Albie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Stander" title="Lionel Stander">Lionel Stander</a> and MacGowran), who are on the run after a heist went wrong. The film opens with Dickie pushing their broken-down car along the tidal causeway of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne" title="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a> island. It is implied that the shootout which occurred during the heist had left Albie bleeding and paralyzed, and Dickie, who is also wounded but still mobile, now seeks to contact their underworld boss, Katelbach. (Like Beckett's Godot, Katelbach is frequently alluded to throughout the course of the film, but never actually appears.) As he searches the island, Dickie discovers that the famous medieval castle is inhabited by an effeminate and neurotically excitable middle-aged Englishman named George (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Pleasence" title="Donald Pleasence">Donald Pleasence</a>), and his adulterous, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nymphomania" title="Nymphomania">nymphomaniacal</a> young French wife, Teresa (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7oise_Dorl%C3%A9ac" title="FranÃ§oise DorlÃ©ac">FranÃ§oise DorlÃ©ac</a>, Catherine Deneuve's older sister). A series of absurd mishaps, both farcical and tragic, ensues when Dickie decides to take the couple hostage in their castle as he waits (in vain) for further instructions from the mysterious Katelbach.</p>

The two of them arrive in a small village near a vampire-infested castle, which they plan to examine.

The ironic and macabre ending is classic Polanski. <i>The Fearless Vampire Killers</i> was Polanski's first feature to be photographed in color with the use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panavision" title="Panavision">Panavision</a> lenses (the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio" title="Aspect ratio">aspect ratio</a> is 2.35:1). The film's striking visual style, with its snow-covered, fairy-tale landscapes, recalls the work of Soviet fantasy filmmakers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Ptushko" title="Aleksandr Ptushko">Aleksandr Ptushko</a> and Alexander Row. Similarly, the richly textured, moonlit-winter-blue color schemes of the village and the snowy valleys evoke the magical, kaleidoscopic paintings of the great Russian-Jewish artist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Chagall" title="Marc Chagall">Marc Chagall</a>, who provides the namesake for the innkeeper in the film. The film is also notable in that it features Polanski's love of winter sports, particularly skiing. In this respect <i>The Fearless Vampire Killers</i> recalls Polanski's 1961 short film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssaki" title="Ssaki">Mammals</a></i>.</p>

Polanski read the book non-stop through the night and called Evans the following morning to tell him he thought it was the more interesting project, and would like the opportunity to write as well as direct it. His first Hollywood film established his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker and both the novel and movie became commercial successes. A horror-thriller set in the trendy Manhattan apartment building "The Dakota", the story is about Rosemary Woodhouse (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a>), an innocent young housewife, originally from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska" title="Omaha, Nebraska">Omaha</a>, who is impregnated by the devil after her narcissistic and ambitious actor husband, Guy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes" title="John Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a>), offers her womb to a coven of local satanists in exchange for stardom. Much of the film concerns Rosemary's suspicions and her increasingly successful attempts to uncover the truth of what is going on. Polanski's screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 9 August 1969, while Polanski was working in London, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Tate" title="Sharon Tate">Sharon Tate</a> and four other people were murdered at the Polanskis' residence in Los Angeles.

He adapted Shakespeare's original text into a screenplay with the British theater critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Tynan" title="Kenneth Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a>, and gained financing for the project through his friendship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Lownes" title="Victor Lownes">Victor Lownes</a>, who was an executive for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_(magazine)" title="Playboy (magazine)">Playboy</a></i> magazine in London at the time. Polanski wanted to make the film in the play's actual historical setting of Scotland, but while scouting for locations there he could find no suitable sites that were still unmarked by telephone poles and other such modern installations. He eventually chose to shoot in an area of Britain which would provide him with a much more convincing medieval landscape complete with picturesque <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_architecture" title="Norman architecture">Norman</a> castles: the rugged environs of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowdonia_National_Park" title="Snowdonia National Park">Snowdonia National Park</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwynedd" title="Gwynedd">Gwynedd</a>, North Wales. The production took six months to complete and exceeded its initial budget by at least $500,000Â  mostly because of weather problems (it rained frequently during the location filming in Wales) as well as Polanski's insistence on shooting multiple takes of several technically challenging scenes in these adverse conditions. When the film finally premiered in December 1971, a number of critics were disturbed by its rampant violence as well as the overwhelming nightmarish atmosphere and unredeemed nihilism of Polanski's very <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernist" title="Modernist">modernist</a> interpretation of Shakespeare (influenced by the writings of Polish drama critic and theoretician, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Kott" title="Jan Kott">Jan Kott</a>). The violent and bloody nature of the film drew comment; film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote that the "corpses and murdersÂ ... so dominate the material that it's difficult to pay attention to the poetry." Polanski was reported to have responded to a comment during filming that the blood-letting was unrealistic, with "You didn't see my house in California last summer. I know about bleeding." In his autobiography Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work, and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate's murder, would be subject to scrutiny and probable cricitism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous.</p>

Many have noted the similarities with <i>Repulsion</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, and together with these two earlier works, <i>The Tenant</i> can be seen as the third installment in a loose trilogy of films called the "Apartment Trilogy" that explore the themes of social alienation and psychic and emotional breakdown.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unwilling to work in the United States after 1978 for fear of jail, Polanski continued to work in Europe.

Unable to personally receive the prize, Polanski nevertheless mused, "Even if I could, I wouldn't, because the last time I went to a festival to get a prize I ended up in jail."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Polanski's first wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Lass" title="Barbara Lass">Barbara Lass</a> (nÃ©e Kwiatkowska), was a Polish actress who also starred in Polanski's 1959 <i>When Angels Fall</i>. The couple were married in 1959 and divorced in 1961. </p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ransohoff" title="Martin Ransohoff">Martin Ransohoff</a> introduced Polanski and rising actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Tate" title="Sharon Tate">Sharon Tate</a> shortly before filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fearless_Vampire_Killers" title="The Fearless Vampire Killers">The Fearless Vampire Killers</a></i>, and during the production the two of them began dating. On <span style="white-space:nowrap;">20 January</span> 1968, Polanski married Sharon Tate in London. In his autobiography, Polanski described his brief time with Tate as the best years of his life. This marriage ended with the death of Tate in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate-LaBianca_murders" title="Tate-LaBianca murders">Manson murders</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1976, Polanski started a romantic relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastassja_Kinski" title="Nastassja Kinski">Nastassja Kinski</a>, when she was 15 years old and he was 43 years old. In 1979, their relationship ended at the completion of filming Polanski's Oscar-nominated <i>Tess</i>, in which Kinski had played the lead role.  </p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1989, Polanski and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuelle_Seigner" title="Emmanuelle Seigner">Emmanuelle Seigner</a> married. They have two children, daughter Morgane and son Elvis. Polanski and his children speak Polish at home.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1969, Polanski and Tate were in London, as Polanski prepared for the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_of_the_Dolphin" title="The Day of the Dolphin">The Day of the Dolphin</a></i>. Tate was pregnant and returned to Los Angeles in July, before her advanced pregnancy made travel impossible; Polanski remained in London and planned to join Tate before she was due to give birth in late August. Polanski asked his friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojciech_Frykowski" title="Wojciech Frykowski">Wojciech Frykowski</a>, and Frykowski's girlfriend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Folger" title="Abigail Folger">Abigail Folger</a> to stay with Tate until his arrival.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the night of 9 August 1969, Tate, Frykowski, Folger and two others were murdered at the Polanski residence. Polanski immediately returned to Los Angeles and was questioned by police who were satisfied that he was not involved in the murders. As the murders were particularly savage, and involved Hollywood celebrities, the case was widely reported throughout the United States and Europe. With little progress in the investigation, some sections of the media speculated that the murders had been a result of the victims' lifestyles, prompting Polanski to confront a group of journalists at a press conference and defend Tate and the other victims against "a multitude of slanders".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 1969, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Manson" title="Charles Manson">Charles Manson</a> and several members of his "family" were arrested and subsequently charged with several murders, including that of Tate. Polanski returned to Europe. He later said that there was nothing to keep him in Hollywood and that to recover, he needed to find seclusion. Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life. In his autobiography, he wrote, "Sharon's death is the only watershed in my life that really matters", and commented that her murder changed his personality from a "boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism" to one of "ingrained pessimismÂ ... eternal dissatisfaction with life".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 11 March 1977, Polanski, 43 years old, was arrested for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_assault" title="Sexual assault">sexual assault</a> of Samantha Geimer, thirty years younger than him. The alleged crime was reported by Geimer's mother and was perpetrated the previous day at the Hollywood home of actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>. The girl testified before a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury" title="Grand jury">grand jury</a> that Polanski gave her both champagne and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methaqualone" title="Methaqualone">Quaalude</a>, a sedative drug, and despite being asked to stop, he performed oral sex, intercourse and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex" title="Anal sex">anal sex</a> upon her. The grand jury returned an indictment charging him with "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">rape</a> by use of drugs, perversion, sodomy, lewd and lascivious act upon a child under 14, and furnishing a controlled substance to a minor". At his arraignment Polanski pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an effort to preserve her anonymity, Geimer's attorney arranged a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> which Polanski accepted, and, under the terms, five charges from the indictment were to be dismissed. On <span style="white-space:nowrap;">8 August</span> 1977, Polanski entered a plea of guilty to ChargeÂ III of the indictment, "Unlawful Sexual Intercourse, in violation of California Penal Code Â§ 261.5", a charge which is synonymous under California law with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statutory_rape" title="Statutory rape">statutory rape</a>. The judge, Laurence J. Rittenband, received a probation report and psychiatric evaluation, both indicating that Polanski should not serve jail time. In response, the filmmaker was ordered to a 90-day psychiatric evaluation at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_State_Prison" title="Chino State Prison">Chino State Prison</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 28 January 1978, Polanski was released after undergoing the in-prison psychiatric evaluation, serving 42 days. Despite expectations and recommendations that he would receive only probation at sentencing, the judge "suggested to Polanski's attorneys" that more jail time and possible deportation were in order. Upon learning of the judge's plans Polanski fled to France on <span style="white-space:nowrap;">1 February</span> 1978, hours before he was to be formally sentenced. As a French <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship" title="Citizenship">citizen</a>, he has been protected from extradition and has mostly lived in France, avoiding countries likely to extradite him. Because he fled prior to sentencing, all six of the original charges remain pending.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Geimer sued Polanski in 1988, alleging sexual assault, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_infliction_of_emotional_distress" title="Intentional infliction of emotional distress">intentional infliction of emotional distress</a> and seduction. In 1993 Polanski agreed to settle with Geimer; however, in August 1996 Polanski still owed her $604,416. Geimer and her lawyers would later confirm the settlement was completed. In 1997, Geimer publicly forgave Polanski and filed a formal request with the Los Angeles Police Department to drop charges against him. In 2003 she wrote an Op Ed piece in the Los Angeles Times advocating for him to be allowed to return to the US to accept an Academy Award.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 26 September 2009, Polanski was taken into custody at the Zurich airport by Swiss police at the request of U.S. authorities, for a 2005 international <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant" title="Arrest warrant">arrest warrant</a>, as he traveled to accept a lifetime achievement award at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich_Film_Festival" title="Zurich Film Festival">Zurich Film Festival</a>. After initially being jailed, on <span style="white-space:nowrap;">4 December</span> 2009 Polanski was granted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_arrest" title="House arrest">house arrest</a> at his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gstaad" title="Gstaad">Gstaad</a> residence on <span style="white-space:nowrap;">US$4.5 million</span> bail, while awaiting decision of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeals" title="Appeals">appeals</a> fighting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extradition" title="Extradition">extradition</a>. On <span style="white-space:nowrap;">22 January</span> 2010, California Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza ruled that Polanski must return to be sentenced.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 12 July 2010, the Swiss authorities announced that they would not extradite Polanski to the U.S. in part due to a fault in the American request for extradition. Polanski was no longer subject to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_tagging" title="Electronic tagging">house arrest</a>, or any monitoring by Swiss authorities. In a press conference held by Swiss Justice Minister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eveline_Widmer-Schlumpf" title="Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf">Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf</a>, she stated that Polanski's extradition to the U.S. was rejected, in part, because U.S. officials failed to produce certain documents, specifically "confidential testimony from a January 2010 hearing on Mr. Polanski's original sentencing agreement." According to Swiss officials, the records were required to determine if Polanski's 42-day court-ordered psychiatric evaluation at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chino_State_Prison" title="Chino State Prison">Chino State Prison</a> constituted Polanski's whole sentence according to the now-deceased Judge Rittenband, reasoning that if this was the correct understanding, then "Roman Polanski would actually have already served his sentence and therefore both the proceedings on which the U.S. extradition request is founded and the request itself would have no foundation."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004, Polanski sued <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_magazine" title="Vanity Fair magazine">Vanity Fair</a></i> magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._E._Hotchner" title="A. E. Hotchner">A. E. Hotchner</a> recounted a claim by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_H._Lapham" title="Lewis H. Lapham">Lewis H. Lapham</a>, editor of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harper%27s_Magazine" title="Harper's Magazine">Harper's</a></i>, that Polanski had made sexual advances towards a young model as he was traveling to Sharon Tate's funeral, claiming that he could make her "the next Sharon Tate". The court permitted Polanski to testify via a video link, after he expressed fears that he might be extradited if he entered the United Kingdom. The trial started in July 2005 and Polanski made English legal history as the first claimant to give evidence by video link. During the trial, which included the testimony of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a> and others, it was claimed that the alleged scene at the famous New York City restaurant Elaine's could not have taken place on the date given, because Polanski only dined at this restaurant three weeks later. Also, the Norwegian model disputed accounts that he had claimed he could make her "the next Sharon Tate," saying Polanski had never spoken to her at all. In the course of the trial, Polanski stated that he had been unfaithful to Tate during their marriage. Polanski was awarded Â£50,000 damages by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice_of_England_and_Wales" title="High Court of Justice of England and Wales">High Court</a> in London. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graydon_Carter" title="Graydon Carter">Graydon Carter</a>, editor of <i>Vanity Fair</i>, responded, "I find it amazing that a man who lives in France <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurisdiction#The_jurisdiction_between_and_within_states" title="Jurisdiction">can sue</a> a magazine that is published in America in a British courtroom".</p>

He and his family rejoice, believing the war will end quickly.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel" title="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> takes over Warsaw after the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> moves out, living conditions for the Jewish population gradually deteriorate as their rights are slowly eroded: first they are allowed only a limited amount of money per family, then they must wear armbands imprinted with the blue <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_David" title="Star of David">Star of David</a> to identify themselves, and eventually, on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a> 1940, they are all forced into the squalid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto" title="Warsaw Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a>. There, they face hunger, persecution and humiliation from the SS and the ever-present fear of death, torture and starvation. The Nazis become increasingly sadistic and the family witnesses many horrors inflicted on other Jews. In one scene, a group of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einsatzgruppen" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>, led by an NCO, go into the apartment across from the Szpilmans. They order the family on the top floor to stand, then when an elderly man in a wheelchair is unable to comply, the SS throw him off the balcony. The rest of the family are then taken out into the street and shot, and the SS drive off, running over the bodies along the way.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before long, the family, along with thousands of others, are rounded up as part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Reinhard" title="Operation Reinhard">Operation Reinhard</a> for deportation to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extermination_camp" title="Extermination camp">extermination facility</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treblinka" title="Treblinka">Treblinka</a>. As the Jews are being forced onto rail cars, Szpilman is saved at the last moment by one of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Ghetto_Police" title="Jewish Ghetto Police">Jewish Ghetto Police</a>, who happens to be a family friend. Separated from his family and loved ones, Szpilman manages to survive. At first he is pressed into a German reconstruction unit inside the ghetto as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_labour" title="Slave labour">slave labourer</a>. During this period, another Jewish labourer confides to Szpilman two critical pieces of information: one, that many Jews who still survive know of the German plans to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">exterminate</a> them, and two, that a Jewish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">uprising</a> against the Germans is being actively prepared for. Szpilman volunteers his help for the plan. He is enlisted to help smuggle weapons into the ghetto, almost being caught at one point.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later, before the uprising starts, Szpilman decides to go into hiding outside the ghetto, relying on the help of non-Jews who still remember him such as an ex-coworker of his from the radio station. While living in hiding, he witnesses many horrors committed by the SS, such as widespread killing, beating and burning of Jews and others (the burning is mostly shown during the two Warsaw uprisings). In 1943, Szpilman also finally witnesses the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto_Uprising" title="Warsaw Ghetto Uprising">Warsaw Ghetto Uprising</a> he helped to bring about, and its aftermath as the SS forcibly enters the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Ghetto" title="Warsaw Ghetto">ghetto</a> and kills nearly all the remaining insurgents. A year goes by and life in Warsaw further deteriorates. Szpilman is forced to flee his first hiding place after a mean-spirited neighbor (who's presumably the landlord, due to the way she sternly questions for his ID) detects his presence and threatens to have him detained and turned in. In his second hiding place, near a German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_hospital" title="Military hospital">military hospital</a>, in a rare moment of humor, he is shown into a room with a piano and then told to be as quiet as possible. Of course, Szpilman can't resist opening the keyboard. Here, he nearly dies due to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice" title="Jaundice">jaundice</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition" title="Malnutrition">malnutrition</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1944, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armia_Krajowa" title="Armia Krajowa">Polish resistance</a> mounts the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Uprising" title="Warsaw Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> against the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_occupation" title="German occupation">German occupation</a>. Szpilman witnesses the Polish insurgents fighting the Germans outside his window. Again, Szpilman narrowly escapes death when a German tank shells the apartment he is hiding in. Warsaw is virtually razed and depopulated as a result of the fighting (see <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_the_Warsaw_Uprising" title="Aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising">Aftermath of the Warsaw Uprising</a>). After the surviving Warsaw population is deported from the city ruins and the escape of German SS from the approaching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Army" title="Soviet Army">Soviet Army</a>, Szpilman is left entirely alone. In buildings still standing, he searches desperately for food. While trying to open a can of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber#Polish" title="Pickled cucumber">Polish pickles</a>, Szpilman is discovered by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hauptmann" title="Hauptmann">captain</a> of the Wehrmacht, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilm_Hosenfeld" title="Wilm Hosenfeld">Wilm Hosenfeld</a> (Kretschmann). Upon questioning Szpilman and discovering that he is a pianist, Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play something for him on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_piano" title="Grand piano">grand piano</a> that happens to be in the building. The decrepit Szpilman, only a shadow of the flamboyant pianist he once was, plays an abbreviated version of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin" title="FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin">Chopin</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballade_No._1_(Chopin)" title="Ballade No. 1 (Chopin)">Ballade in G minor</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hosenfeld lets Szpilman continue hiding in the attic of the building and even brings him food regularly, thus saving his life. Another few weeks go by, and the German troops are forced to withdraw from Warsaw due to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vistula%E2%80%93Oder_Offensive" title="Vistulaâ€“Oder Offensive">advance of the Red Army</a> troops. Before leaving the area, Hosenfeld asks Szpilman what his name is, and, upon hearing it, remarks that it is apt for a pianist (Szpilman being the Polish rendering of the German <i>Spielmann</i>, meaning "man who plays"). Hosenfeld also promises to listen for Szpilman on Polish Radio. He gives Szpilman his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> uniform <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatcoat" title="Greatcoat">greatcoat</a> and leaves. Later, that coat is almost fatal for Szpilman when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_First_Army" title="Polish First Army">Polish troops</a>, liberating the ruins of Warsaw, take him for a German officer and shoot at him. He is eventually able to convince them that he is Polish, and they stop shooting.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As newly freed prisoners of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> walk home, they pass a fenced-in enclosure of German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a>, guarded by Soviet soldiers. An injured German prisoner, who turns out to be Hosenfeld, calls out to the passing ex-prisoners. Hosenfeld begs one of them, a violinist of Szpilman's acquaintance, to contact Szpilman to free him. Szpilman, who has gone back to playing live on Warsaw Radio, arrives at the site too late; all the prisoners have been removed to their fates along with any trace of the stockade. In the film's final scene, Szpilman triumphantly performs Chopin's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andante_spianato_et_Grande_Polonaise_brillante" title="Andante spianato et Grande Polonaise brillante">Grand Polonaise brillante</a></i> in E flat major to a large audience in Warsaw. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_cards" title="Title cards">Title cards</a> shown just before the end credits reveal that Szpilman continued to live in Warsaw and died in 2000, but that Hosenfeld died in 1952 in a Soviet <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner-of-war_camp" title="Prisoner-of-war camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>, but was later posthumously honored for saving Szpilman's life and turning against his own criminal regime.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal photography on <i>The Pianist</i> began on 9 February 2001 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Babelsberg" title="Studio Babelsberg">Studio Babelsberg</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam" title="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>. The Warsaw Ghetto and the surrounding city were recreated on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlot" title="Backlot">backlot</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studios" title="Babelsberg Studios">Babelsberg Studios</a> as they would have looked during the war. Old Soviet army barracks were used to create the ruined city, as they were going to be destroyed anyway.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first scenes of the film were shot at the old army barracks. Soon after, the filmmakers moved to a villa in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potsdam" title="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, which served as the house where Szpilman meets Hosenfeld. On 2 March 2001, filming then moved to an abandoned Soviet army hospital in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beelitz" title="Beelitz">Beelitz</a>, Germany. The scenes that featured the Germans destroying the hospital with flame throwers were filmed here. On 15 March filming finally moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babelsberg_Studios" title="Babelsberg Studios">Babelsberg Studios</a>. The first scene shot at the studio was the scene in which Szpilman witnesses a resistance mounted by the Jews from the Ghetto, which is eventually ended by the Nazis. The scene was complex and technically demanding as it involved various stunts and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosives" title="Explosives">explosives</a>. Filming at the studios ended on 26 March and moved to Warsaw on 29 March. The rundown district of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praga" title="Praga">Praga</a> was chosen for filming because of its abundance of original buildings. The art department built onto these original buildings, re-creating World War IIâ€“era Poland with signs and posters from the period. Additional filming also took place around Warsaw. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umschlagplatz" title="Umschlagplatz">Umschlagplatz</a> scene where Szpilman, his family and hundreds of other Jews wait to be taken to the extermination camps was filmed at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defence_University_in_Warsaw" title="National Defence University in Warsaw">National Defence University in Warsaw</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal photography ended in July 2001, and was followed by months of post-production, which took place in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film received extremely positive reviews from critics and Adrien Brody's performance was met with near universal acclaim. <i>The Pianist</i> currently holds a score of 95% on the film rating website Rotten Tomatoes, with the Cream of the Crop critics rating the movie with a score of 100%. Metacritic rates the movie as 85% based on 40 reviews.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> noted that "perhaps that impassive quality reflects what Polanski wants to say... By showing Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a heroâ€”as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and the kindness of a few non-Jewsâ€”Polanski is reflecting... his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never healed."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_Releasing" title="Optimum Releasing">Optimum Home Entertainment</a> released <i>The Pianist</i> to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc_Region_Code" title="Blu-ray Disc Region Code">European market</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray" title="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> as part of their <i>StudioCanal Collection</i> on September 13, 2010 and this is the film's second release on Blu-ray. The first was troublesome due to issues with subtitles: the initial BD lacked subtitles for spoken German dialogue. Optimum later rectified this  but the initial release also lacked notable special features. The <i>StudioCanal Collection</i> version includes an extensive Behind the Scenes look as well as several interviews with the makers of the film and Szpilman's relatives.</p>

      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>The piano piece heard at the beginning of the film is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin" title="FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin">Chopin</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne_Op._Posth._in_C-sharp_minor_(Chopin)" title="Nocturne Op. Posth. in C-sharp minor (Chopin)">Nocturne in C-sharp minor <i>Lento con gran espressione</i></a>, Op. posth.</li>
	<li>The piano piece that is heard being played a next door neighbour while Szpilman was in hiding at an apartment was the <i>Mazurka in A Minor, Op. 17, No. 4</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Chopin" title="Frederic Chopin">Frederic Chopin</a>.</li>
	<li>The piano music heard in the abandoned house when Szpilman had just discovered a hiding place in the attic was the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Sonata_No._14_(Beethoven)" title="Piano Sonata No. 14 (Beethoven)"><i>Moonlight</i> Sonata</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven</a>. It would later be revealed that German officer Hosenfeld was the pianist. The German composition juxtaposed with the mainly Polish/Chopin selection of Szpilman.</li>
	<li>The piano piece played when Szpilman is confronted by Hosenfeld is Chopin's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballade_No._1_(Chopin)" title="Ballade No. 1 (Chopin)">Ballade No. 1 in G minor</a>, Op. 23. Also, the version played in the movie was shortened. The entire piece lasts 9-10 minutes.</li>
	<li>The cello piece heard at the middle of the film, played by Dorota, is the Prelude from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Bach</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cello_Suites_(Bach)" title="Cello Suites (Bach)">Cello Suite No. 1</a>.</li>
	<li>The piano piece heard at the end of the film, played with an orchestra, is Chopin's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andante_spianato_et_Grande_Polonaise_brillante" title="Andante spianato et Grande Polonaise brillante">Grande Polonaise brillante</a></i>, Op. 22.</li>
	<li>Shots of Szpilman's hands playing the piano in close-up were provided by Polish classical pianist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Olejniczak" title="Janusz Olejniczak">Janusz Olejniczak</a> (b. 1952), who also performed on the soundtrack.</li>
	<li>Since Polanski wanted the film to be as realistic as possible, any scene showing Brody playing was actually his playing voiced over by recordings provided by Janusz Olejniczak. In order for Brody's playing to look like it was at the level of WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Szpilman's, he spent many months prior to and during the filming practicing so that his keystrokes on the piano would convince viewers that it was him playing. It was never specified whether or not it was actually Adrien Brody playing at certain points in the film such as the beginning where WÅ‚adysÅ‚aw Szpilman's playing is interrupted by German bombing.</li>
