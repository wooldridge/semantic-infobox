To combat the disease, his parents administered a painful treatment regimen developed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Kenny" title="Elizabeth Kenny">Sister Elizabeth Kenny</a> that consisted of applying hot woolen blankets to his limbs and stretching his muscles. This allowed him to recover from most effects of the disease.

Alda frequented Sol &amp; Sol deli on Palisade Ave. in the nearby town of Englewood, N.J. in real life - a fact mirrored in his character's daydream about eating whitefish from the establishment in an episode of <i>M*A*S*H</i> in which Hawkeye sustains a head injury.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alda began his career in the 1950s as a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compass_Players" title="Compass Players">Compass Players</a> comedy revue.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alda made his Hollywood acting debut as a supporting player in <i>Gone are the Days!</i> â€“ a film version of the highly successful Broadway play <i>Purlie Victorious</i>, which co-starred veteran actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Dee" title="Ruby Dee">Ruby Dee</a> and her husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossie_Davis" title="Ossie Davis">Ossie Davis</a>. Other film roles would follow, such as his portrayal of author, humorist, and actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Plimpton" title="George Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Lion" title="Paper Lion">Paper Lion</a></i> (1968) as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Extraordinary_Seaman" title="The Extraordinary Seaman">The Extraordinary Seaman</a></i> (1969) and the occult-murder-suspense thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mephisto_Waltz" title="The Mephisto Waltz">The Mephisto Waltz</a></i>, with actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacqueline_Bisset" title="Jacqueline Bisset">Jacqueline Bisset</a>. During this time, Alda frequently appeared as a panelist on the 1968 revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_My_Line%3F" title="What's My Line?">What's My Line?</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In early 1972, Alda auditioned for and was selected to play the role of "Hawkeye Pierce" in the TV adaptation of the 1970 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASH_(film)" title="MASH (film)">MASH</a></i>. He was nominated for 21 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards" title="Emmy Awards">Emmy Awards</a>, and won five. He took part in writing 19 episodes, including the finale, and directed 32. When he won his first Emmy Award for writing, he was so happy that he performed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartwheel_(gymnastics)" title="Cartwheel (gymnastics)">cartwheel</a> before running up to the stage to accept the award. He was also the first person to win Emmy Awards for acting, writing and directing for the same series. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Richard_Hornberger" title="H. Richard Hornberger">Richard Hooker</a>, who wrote the novel on which <i>M*A*S*H</i> was based, did not like Alda's portrayal of Hawkeye Pierce (Hooker, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a>, had based Hawkeye on himself, whereas Alda took the character in a more left-wing direction). Alda also directed the show's 1983 2Â½ hour series finale "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodbye,_Farewell,_and_Amen" title="Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen">Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen</a>" which remains <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-watched_television_episodes" title="List of most-watched television episodes">the single most-watched episode</a> of any TV series. Alda is the only series regular to appear in all 251 episodes.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As more and more of the original series writers left the series, Alda gained more control and by the final seasons he had become project and creative consultant. Under his watch, <i>M*A*S*H</i> more openly addressed political issues. As a result, the 11 years of <i>M*A*S*H</i> are generally split into two eras: the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Gelbart" title="Larry Gelbart">Larry Gelbart</a>/<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Reynolds" title="Gene Reynolds">Gene Reynolds</a> "comedy" years (1972â€“1977), and the Alan Alda "dramatic" years (1977â€“1983).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his <i>M*A*S*H</i> years, Alda made several <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_show" title="Game show">game show</a> appearances, most notably in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_$10,000_Pyramid" title="The $10,000 Pyramid">The $10,000 Pyramid</a></i> and as a frequent panelist on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Tell_The_Truth" title="To Tell The Truth">To Tell The Truth</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alda's prominence in the enormously successful <i>M*A*S*H</i> gave him a platform to speak out on political topics, and he has been a strong and vocal supporter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_rights" title="Women's rights">women's rights</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminist_Movement_in_the_United_States_(1963-1982)" title="Feminist Movement in the United States (1963-1982)">feminist movement</a>.

In 1976, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Globe" title="Boston Globe">Boston Globe</a></i> dubbed him "the quintessential Honorary Woman: a feminist icon" for his activism on behalf of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment" title="Equal Rights Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>. As a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> activist, he has been a target for some <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_conservative" title="Political conservative">political</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservative" title="Social conservative">social conservatives</a>.</p>

Although <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Parnell" title="Peter Parnell">Peter Parnell</a> wrote the play, Alda both produced and inspired it.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During <i>M*A*S*H'</i>s run and continuing through the 1980s, Alda embarked on a successful career as a writer and director, with the ensemble <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramedy" title="Dramedy">dramedy</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(film)" title="The Four Seasons (film)"><i>The Four Seasons</i></a> being perhaps his most notable hit. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy%27s_Wedding_(film)" title="Betsy's Wedding (film)">Betsy's Wedding</a></i> is his last directing credit to date. After <i>M*A*S*H</i>, Alda took on a series of roles that either parodied or directly contradicted his "nice guy" image. His role as a pompous celebrity television producer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a></i> was widely seen as a self-parody, although Alda denied this.</p>

Hughes re-shoots <i>Hell's Angels</i> with sound, costing another year and $1.7 million. <i>Hell's Angels</i> released as a sound film in 1930 is a huge hit, and Hughes also produces <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1932_film)" title="Scarface (1932 film)">Scarface</a></i> (1932) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outlaw" title="The Outlaw">The Outlaw</a></i> (1943).

As Hughes' fame grows, he is seen with more starlets.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hughes takes an interest in commercial-passenger travel, and purchases majority interest in Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA), the predecessor to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines" title="Trans World Airlines">Trans World Airlines</a>.

Three years later, he flies around the world in four days, shattering the previous record by three days.

Brewster has just introduced the Commercial Airline Bill, which will give world expansion solely to Pan Am. Trippe advises Brewster to check into the "disquieting rumors about Mr. Hughes."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hepburn and Hughes eventually break up when she announces that she has fallen in love with her co-star (implied to be her would-be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_partnership" title="Domestic partnership">domestic partner</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>).</p>

He also fights the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association</a> over the steamy scenes in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outlaw" title="The Outlaw">The Outlaw</a></i>. He learns of Pan Am's efforts to run TWA off the map yet secures contracts with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces" title="United States Army Air Forces">Army Air Forces</a> on two projects, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_aircraft" title="Surveillance aircraft">spy plane</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft" title="Military transport aircraft">troop transport</a>. By 1946, Hughes has only finished the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_XF-11" title="Hughes XF-11">XF-11 reconnaissance aircraft</a> and is now building the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-4_Hercules" title="Hughes H-4 Hercules">H-4 Hercules</a> ("Spruce Goose") <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_boat" title="Flying boat">flying boat</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the strain of meeting deadlines and budgets, Hughes' sanity begins to deteriorate, characterized by the repetition of phrases, and exhibiting a phobia over dust and germs. That July, he takes the XF-11 for a test flight. One of the propellers malfunctions which causes the aircraft to crash in a neighborhood of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills,_California" title="Beverly Hills, California">Beverly Hills</a>. Rushed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedars-Sinai_Medical_Center" title="Cedars-Sinai Medical Center">Cedars of Lebanon Hospital</a>, he slowly recuperates and learns the H-4 Hercules transport is no longer needed, but orders production to continue. When he is discharged, the whole TWA fleet is built and ready to go, but he is in danger of being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">bankrupted</a> by the airline and his "flying boat".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He grows increasingly paranoid, placing microphones all over his house and tapping Gardner's phone lines to keep track of any suspicious activity. After being confronted by Gardner, he returns home to find the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> searching his house for incriminating evidence that he <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzling" title="Embezzling">embezzled</a> government funds. The incident is both a powerful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_trauma" title="Psychological trauma">trauma</a> for Hughes and gives his enemies knowledge about his condition. Hughes meets with Brewster, who offers to drop the charges if Hughes supports the CAB and sells the TWA stock to Trippe. Hughes sinks into a deep <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> afterwards, shutting himself in his screening room, growing ever more paranoid and detached from reality; terrified of germs, he urinates into dozens of empty milk bottles. Hepburn tries to visit him, but is unable to help. Trippe then pays Hughes a visit, but an enraged Hughes vows he will never sell TWA. Trippe warns Dietrich that the world will see what Hughes has become if he goes to the hearings. After nearly three months, Hughes finally emerges and prepares to face the Senate, with encouragement from Ava Gardner, who helps him get cleaned up.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A reinvigorated Hughes arrives at the hearings, and starts off with counter-claiming Brewster's charges: "Why not tell the truth, Senator? Why not tell the truth that this investigation was really born on the day that TWA first decided to fly to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>?" In retaliation, Brewster formally states that Hughes charged the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">Defense Department</a> $56 million for aircraft that never flew. Hughes defends himself and reveals that Trippe essentially <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery" title="Bribery">bribed</a> Brewster to hold the hearings, ending Trippe's quest to monopolize the flight industry.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hughes successfully test flies the flying boat himself. After the flight, he talks to Dietrich and his mechanic, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Odekirk" title="Glenn Odekirk">Glenn Odekirk</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Ross" title="Matt Ross">Matt Ross</a>), about a new <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_airliner" title="Jet airliner">jetliner</a> for TWA (the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avro_Canada_Jetliner" title="Avro Canada Jetliner">Avro C102 <i>Jetliner</i></a>) and makes a date with Gardner at a celebration party on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach</a> shoreline. Hughes seems free of his inner demons until he sees three attendants in business suits and white gloves edging towards him, which triggers an obsessive-compulsive fit as he begins repeating "The way of the future." Dietrich and Odekirk take Hughes in a bathroom and hide him there, while Dietrich fetches a doctor and Odekirk stands outside guarding the door. Alone inside, Hughes has a flashback to his boyhood, being washed by his mother and resolving he will fly the fastest aircraft ever built, make the biggest movies ever and become the richest man in the world. As the film ends he repeatedly mutters "the way of the future... the way of the future" into a darkened mirror.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first 50 minutes of the film, scenes appear in shades of only red and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyan" title="Cyan">cyan</a> blue; green objects are rendered as blue. This was done, according to Scorsese, to emulate the look of early <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipack_color" title="Bipack color">bipack color</a> movies, in particular the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicolor" title="Multicolor">Multicolor</a> process, which Hughes himself owned, emulating the available technology of the era. Similarly, many of the scenes depicting events occurring after 1935 are treated to emulate the saturated appearance of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor#Three-strip_Technicolor" title="Technicolor">three-strip</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>. Other scenes were stock footage <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization" title="Film colorization">colorized</a> and incorporated into the film. The color effects were created by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_Films" title="Legend Films">Legend Films</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Aviator</i>, scale models were used to duplicate many of the flying scenes. When Martin Scorsese began planning his aviation epic, a decision was made to film flying sequences with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_model" title="Scale model">scale models</a> rather than <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_image" title="Computer-generated image">CGI</a> special effects. The critical reaction to the CGI models in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor_(film)" title="Pearl Harbor (film)">Pearl Harbor</a></i> (2001) had been a crucial factor in Scorsese's decision to use full-scale static and scale models in this case. The building and filming of the flying models proved both cost-effective and timely.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The primary scale models were the Spruce Goose and the XF-11; both miniatures were designed and fabricated over a period of several months by New Deal Studios. The 375Â lb (170 kg) Spruce Goose model had a wingspan of 20Â ft (6.1 m) while the 750Â lb (340 kg) XF-11 had a 25Â ft (7.6 m) wingspan. Each was built as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_control" title="Motion control">motion control</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_effect" title="Miniature effect">miniature</a> used for "beauty shots" of the model taking off and in flight as well as in dry dock and under construction at the miniature Hughes Hangar built as well by New Deal Studios. The XF-11 was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineered</a> from photographs and some rare drawings and then modeled in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros_3D" title="Rhinoceros 3D">Rhinoceros 3D</a> by the New Deal art department. These 3D models of the Spruce Goose as well as the XF-11 were then used for patterns and construction drawings for the model makers. In addition to the aircraft, the homes that the XF-11 crashes into were fabricated at 1:4 scale to match the 1:4 scale XF-11. The model was rigged to be crashed and break up several times for different shots.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Additional castings of the Spruce Goose flying boat and XF-11 models were provided for new radio controlled flying versions assembled by the team of model builders from Aero Telemetry. The Aero Telemetry team was given only three months to complete three models including the 450Â lb H-1 Racer, with an 18Â ft (5.5 m) wingspan, that had to stand-in for the full scale replica that was destroyed in a crash, shortly before principal photography began.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The models were shot on location at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach</a> and other California sites from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> or raft platforms. The short but much heralded flight of Hughesâ€™ <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hughes_H-4_Hercules" title="Hughes H-4 Hercules">HK-1 Hercules</a> on 2 November 1947 was realistically recreated in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Long_Beach" title="Port of Long Beach">Port of Long Beach</a>.
