She has won two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> and received several other awards and nominations.

She also produced and starred in several exercise videos released between 1982 and 1995.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda has been an activist for many political causes, one of the most notable and controversial of which was her opposition to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>. She has also protested the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" title="Iraq War">Iraq War</a> and violence against women.

Fonda currently serves on the board of the organization. Since 2001, Fonda has been a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christian</a>. She published an autobiography in 2005.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda was born in New York City, the daughter of actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> and socialite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Ford_Seymour" title="Frances Ford Seymour">Frances Ford Seymour</a>, and named <b>Lady Jayne Seymour Fonda</b>. Henry Fonda had distant <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_American" title="Dutch American">Dutch</a> ancestry, and the surname Fonda originates from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagum" title="Eagum">Eagum</a>, also spelled Augum or Agum, a village in the heart of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friesland" title="Friesland">Friesland</a>, a northern province of the Netherlands. The "Lady" part of Jane Fonda's name was apparently inspired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Seymour" title="Lady Jane Seymour">Lady Jane Seymour</a>, to whom she is distantly related on her mother's side. Her brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fonda" title="Peter Fonda">Peter Fonda</a> (born 1940), and her niece <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Fonda" title="Bridget Fonda">Bridget Fonda</a> (born 1964), are also actors. Fonda had a half sister, Frances, who died in 2008. She is the mother of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Vadim" title="Vanessa Vadim">Vanessa Vadim</a> from her marriage to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Vadim" title="Roger Vadim">Roger Vadim</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Garity" title="Troy Garity">Troy Garity</a> from her marriage to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Hayden" title="Tom Hayden">Tom Hayden</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On April 14, 1950, her mother committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> after which Jane voluntarily sought treatment at a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>. Her father subsequently married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Blanchard_(socialite)" title="Susan Blanchard (socialite)">Susan Blanchard</a>, but this marriage ended in divorce. At 15, Fonda taught dance at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Island_Pines,_New_York" title="Fire Island Pines, New York">Fire Island Pines, New York</a>. She attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Academy" title="Greenwich Academy">Greenwich Academy</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich,_Connecticut" title="Greenwich, Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Acting_career">Acting career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before starting her acting career, Fonda was a fashion <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)" title="Model (person)">model</a>, gracing the cover of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogue_(magazine)" title="Vogue (magazine)">Vogue</a></i> twice. Fonda became interested in acting in 1954, while appearing with her father in a charity performance of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Country_Girl" title="The Country Girl">The Country Girl</a></i>, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Community_Playhouse" title="Omaha Community Playhouse">Omaha Community Playhouse</a>. She attended The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Willard_School" title="Emma Willard School">Emma Willard School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy,_New_York" title="Troy, New York">Troy, New York</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassar_College" title="Vassar College">Vassar College</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poughkeepsie_(town),_New_York" title="Poughkeepsie (town), New York">Poughkeepsie</a>, where she was an undistinguished student.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She recalled that at the age of five, she and her brother, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fonda" title="Peter Fonda">Peter Fonda</a>, acted out Western stories similar to those her father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, played in the movies. After graduating from Vassar she went to Paris for two years to study art. Upon returning, she met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Strasberg" title="Lee Strasberg">Lee Strasberg</a> and the meeting changed the course of her life, Fonda saying, "I went to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%27s_Studio" title="Actor's Studio">Actor's Studio</a> and Lee Strasberg told me I had talent. Real talent. It was the first time that anyone, except my fatherâ€”who had to say soâ€”told me I was good. At anything. It was a turning point in my life. I went to bed thinking about acting. I woke up thinking about acting. It was like the roof had come off my life!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her stage work in the late 1950s laid the foundation for her film career in the 1960s. She averaged almost two movies a year throughout the decade, starting in 1960 with <i>Tall Story</i>, in which she recreated one of her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> roles as a college cheerleader pursuing a basketball star, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Perkins" title="Anthony Perkins">Anthony Perkins</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_of_Adjustment_(film)" title="Period of Adjustment (film)">Period of Adjustment</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk_on_the_Wild_Side_(film)" title="Walk on the Wild Side (film)">Walk on the Wild Side</a></i> followed in 1962. In <i>Walk on the Wild Side</i>, Fonda played a prostitute, and earned a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> for Most Promising Newcomer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1963, she appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_in_New_York" title="Sunday in New York">Sunday in New York</a></i>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsday" title="Newsday">Newsday</a></i> called her "the loveliest and most gifted of all our new young actresses". However, she also had her detractorsâ€”in the same year, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Lampoon" title="Harvard Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a></i> named her the "Year's Worst Actress". Fonda's career breakthrough came with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Ballou" title="Cat Ballou">Cat Ballou</a></i> (1965), in which she played a schoolmarm turned outlaw. This comedy <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">Western</a> received five <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> nominations and was one of the year's top ten films at the box office. It was considered by many to have been the film that brought Fonda to stardom at the age of twenty-eight. After this came the comedies <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Wednesday" title="Any Wednesday">Any Wednesday</a></i> (1966) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot_in_the_Park_(film)" title="Barefoot in the Park (film)">Barefoot in the Park</a></i> (1967), the latter co-starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1968, she played the lead role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> spoof <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbarella_(film)" title="Barbarella (film)">Barbarella</a></i>, which established her status as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_symbol" title="Sex symbol">sex symbol</a>. In contrast, the tragedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Shoot_Horses,_Don%27t_They%3F_(film)" title="They Shoot Horses, Don't They? (film)">They Shoot Horses, Don't They?</a></i> (1969) won her critical acclaim, and she earned her first Oscar nomination for the role. Fonda was very selective by the end of the 1960s, turning down lead roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosemary%27s_Baby_(film)" title="Rosemary's Baby (film)">Rosemary's Baby</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde_(film)" title="Bonnie and Clyde (film)">Bonnie and Clyde</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda won her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> in 1971, again playing a prostitute, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamine" title="Gamine">gamine</a> Bree Daniels, in the murder mystery <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klute" title="Klute">Klute</a></i>. She won her second Oscar in 1978 for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_Home" title="Coming Home">Coming Home</a></i>, the story of a disabled Vietnam War veteran's difficulty in re-entering civilian life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between <i>Klute</i> in 1971 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_with_Dick_and_Jane_(1977_film)" title="Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)">Fun With Dick and Jane</a></i> in 1977, Fonda did not have a major film success, even though she appeared in films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Doll%27s_House_(1973_Losey_film)" title="A Doll's House (1973 Losey film)">A Doll's House</a></i> (1973), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steelyard_Blues" title="Steelyard Blues">Steelyard Blues</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Bird_(1976_film)" title="The Blue Bird (1976 film)">The Blue Bird</a></i> (1976). From comments ascribed to her in interviews, some have inferred that she personally blamed the situation on anger at her outspoken political views â€“ "I can't say I was blacklisted, but I was greylisted." However, in her 2005 autobiography, <i>My Life So Far</i>, she categorically rejected such simplification. "The suggestion is that because of my actions against the war my career had been destroyed ... But the truth is that my career, far from being destroyed after the war, flourished with a vigor it had not previously enjoyed." From her own point of view, her absence from the silver screen was related more to the fact that her political activism provided a new focus in her life. By the same token her return to acting with a series of 'issue-driven' films was a reflection of this new focus. "When I hear admonitions ... warning outspoken actors to remember 'what happened to Jane Fonda back in the seventies', this has me scratching my head: And what would that be...?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972, Fonda starred as a reporter alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Montand" title="Yves Montand">Yves Montand</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>'s and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Gorin" title="Jean-Pierre Gorin">Jean-Pierre Gorin</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tout_va_bien" title="Tout va bien">Tout va bien</a></i>. The film's directors then made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_Jane" title="Letter to Jane">Letter to Jane</a></i>, in which the two spent nearly an hour discussing a news photograph of Fonda.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through her production company, IPC Films, she produced films that helped return her to star status. The 1977 comedy film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fun_with_Dick_and_Jane_(1977_film)" title="Fun with Dick and Jane (1977 film)">Fun With Dick and Jane</a></i> is generally considered her "comeback" picture. She also received positive reviews, BAFTA and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress, and an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Hellman" title="Lillian Hellman">Lillian Hellman</a> in the 1977 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_(1977_film)" title="Julia (1977 film)">Julia</a></i>. During this period, Fonda announced that she would make films only that focused on important issues, and she generally stuck to her word. She turned down <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Unmarried_Woman" title="An Unmarried Woman">An Unmarried Woman</a></i> because she felt the part was not relevant. She followed with popular and successful films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_China_Syndrome" title="The China Syndrome">The China Syndrome</a></i> (1979), about a cover-up of an accident in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power_plant" title="Nuclear power plant">nuclear power plant</a>; and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Electric_Horseman" title="The Electric Horseman">The Electric Horseman</a></i> (1979) with her previous co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1980, Fonda starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_to_Five" title="Nine to Five">Nine to Five</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lily_Tomlin" title="Lily Tomlin">Lily Tomlin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_Parton" title="Dolly Parton">Dolly Parton</a>. The film was a critical and box office success. Fonda had long wanted to work with her father, hoping it would help their strained relationship. She achieved this goal when she purchased the screen rights to the play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Golden_Pond_(play)" title="On Golden Pond (play)">On Golden Pond</a></i> specifically for her father and herself. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Golden_Pond_(1981_film)" title="On Golden Pond (1981 film)">On Golden Pond</a></i>, which also starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>, brought Henry Fonda his only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, which Jane accepted on his behalf, as he was ill and home bound. He died five months later.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda continued appearing in feature films throughout the 1980s, most notably in the role of Dr. Martha Livingston in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_of_God_(film)" title="Agnes of God (film)">Agnes of God</a></i>. She was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for her portrayal of an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a> murder suspect in the 1986 thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Morning_After_(1986_film)" title="The Morning After (1986 film)">The Morning After</a></i>. She ended the decade by appearing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Gringo" title="Old Gringo">Old Gringo</a></i>. This was followed by the romantic drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_%26_Iris" title="Stanley &amp; Iris">Stanley &amp; Iris</a></i> (1990), which would be her final film for 15 years.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For many years, Fonda was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballet" title="Ballet">ballet</a> enthusiast, but after fracturing her foot while filming <i>The China Syndrome</i> she was no longer able to participate. To compensate, she began actively participating in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobics" title="Aerobics">aerobics</a> and strengthening exercises under the direction of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Leni_Cazden&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Leni Cazden (page does not exist)">Leni Cazden</a>. The <i>Leni Workout</i> became the <i>Jane Fonda Workout</i> and thus began a second career for her, which continued for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers" title="Baby boomers">baby boomers</a> who were then approaching middle age.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled <i>Jane Fonda's Workout</i>, inspired by her best-selling book, <i>Jane Fonda's Workout Book</i>. The <i>Jane Fonda's Workout</i> video eventually sold 17 million copies: more than any other home video. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCR" title="VCR">VCR</a> in order to watch and perform the workout in the privacy and convenience of their own homes. Fonda subsequently released 23 workout videos, five workout books and thirteen audio programs. Her most recent workout video was released in 1995.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1991, after three decades in film, Fonda announced her retirement from the film industry.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 1970, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Gardner_(activist)" title="Fred Gardner (activist)">Fred Gardner</a>, Fonda and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a> formed the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_The_Army_tour" title="Free The Army tour">FTA tour</a> ("Free The Army", a play on the troop expression "Fuck The Army"), an anti-war road show designed as an answer to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Service_Organizations" title="United Service Organizations">USO</a> tour. The tour, referred to as "political <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a>" by Fonda, visited military towns along the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">West Coast</a>, with the goal of establishing a dialogue with soldiers about their upcoming deployments to Vietnam. The dialogue was made into a movie (<i>F.T.A.</i>) that contained strong, frank criticism of the war by service men and women. It was released in 1972.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the same year, Fonda spoke out against the war at a rally organized by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Against_the_War" title="Vietnam Veterans Against the War">Vietnam Veterans Against the War</a> (VVAW) in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Forge,_Pennsylvania" title="Valley Forge, Pennsylvania">Valley Forge, Pennsylvania</a>. She offered to help raise funds for VVAW, and, for her efforts, was rewarded with the title of Honorary National Coordinator. On November 3, 1970, Fonda started a tour of college campuses on which she raised funds for the organization. As noted by the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, Fonda was a "major patron" of the VVAW. In a 1970 address at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan_State_University" title="Michigan State University">Michigan State University</a> Fonda gave a speech saying; "I would think that if you understood what Communism was, you would hope, you would pray on your knees, that we would someday become communists."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda visited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi" title="Hanoi">Hanoi</a> in July 1972. Among other statements, she repeated the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnamese" title="North Vietnamese">North Vietnamese</a> claim that the United States had been <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombing_of_Vietnam%27s_dikes" title="Bombing of Vietnam's dikes">deliberately targeting the dike system along the Red River</a> stating that â€œI believe in my heart, profoundly, that the dikes are being bombed on purposeâ€&#157;. Columnist Joseph Kraft, who was also touring North Vietnam, believed that the damage to the dikes was incidental and was being used as propaganda by Hanoi, and that if the U.S. Air Force were "truly going after the dikes, it would do so in a methodical, not a harum-scarum way."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In North Vietnam, Fonda was photographed seated on an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_battery" title="Anti-aircraft battery">anti-aircraft battery</a>. In her 2005 autobiography, she writes that she was manipulated into sitting on the battery. Later she claimed to have been horrified at the implications of the pictures and stated that she regretted the pictures. During her trip, Fonda also made ten propagandistic radio broadcasts in which she denounced American political and military leaders as "war criminals". Fonda has defended her decision to travel to North Vietnam and has defended her radio broadcasts.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During this visit, she also visited American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoners_of_war" title="Prisoners of war">prisoners of war</a> (POWs), and brought back messages from them to their families. When cases of torture began to emerge among POWs returning to the United States, Fonda called the returning POWs "hypocrites and liars." She added, "These were not men who had been tortured. These were not men who had been starved. These were not men who had been brainwashed." On the subject of torture in general, Fonda told <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> in 1973, "I'm quite sure that there were incidents of torture... but the pilots who were saying it was the policy of the Vietnamese and that it was systematic, I believe that's a lie." Fonda further stated that the POWs were "military careerists and professional killers" who are "trying to make themselves look self-righteous, but they are war criminals according to the law."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The POW camp visits also led to persistent storiesâ€”decades later circulated widely on the Internet and via emailâ€”that the POWs she met had spat on her, or attempted to sneak notes to her which she had then reported to the North Vietnamese, leading to further abuse. However, interviews with two of the alleged victims specifically named in the emails, found these allegations to be false as they had never met Fonda.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972, Fonda helped fund and organize the Indochina Peace Campaign. It continued to mobilize antiwar activists across the nation after the 1973 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Accords" title="Paris Peace Accords">Paris Peace Agreement</a>, through 1975, when the United States withdrew from Vietnam.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975, Fonda continued to express support for the Communist government. For example, she sharply denounced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Baez" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a>, who had pointed out human rights violations in the new Vietnam, which Fonda continued to deny. She also named her son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Garity" title="Troy Garity">Troi</a> - in honour of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nguyen_Van_Troi" title="Nguyen Van Troi">Nguyen Van Troi</a>, who had attempted to assassinate Defence Secretary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a 1988 interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Walters" title="Barbara Walters">Barbara Walters</a>, Fonda expressed regret for some of her comments and actions, stating:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, critics pointed out that her apology came at a time when a group of New England Veterans had launched a campaign to disrupt a film project she was working on, leading to the charge that her apology was motivated at least partially by self-interest.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> interview on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated that she had no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, with the exception of the anti-aircraft gun photo. She stated that the incident was a "betrayal" of American forces and of the "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propaganda</a> and pride for her anti-war activism: "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda... It's not something that I will apologize for." Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had to do anything that I could to expose the lies and help end the war."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda has been a longtime supporter of feminist causes, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Day_(movement)" title="V-Day (movement)">V-Day</a>, a movement to stop violence against women, inspired by the off-Broadway hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vagina_Monologues" title="The Vagina Monologues">The Vagina Monologues</a></i>, of which she is an honorary chairperson.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001, Fonda established the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jane_Fonda_Center_for_Adolescent_Reproductive_Health&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health (page does not exist)">Jane Fonda Center for Adolescent Reproductive Health</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emory_University" title="Emory University">Emory University</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta,_Georgia" title="Atlanta, Georgia">Atlanta, Georgia</a>; the goal of the center is to prevent adolescent pregnancy through training and program development.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a march through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciudad_Ju%C3%A1rez" title="Ciudad JuÃ¡rez">Ciudad JuÃ¡rez</a>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field" title="Sally Field">Sally Field</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Ensler" title="Eve Ensler">Eve Ensler</a>, and other women, urging <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> to provide sufficient resources to newly appointed officials helping investigate the murders of hundreds of women in the rough border city.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda strongly feels that many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_stereotypes" title="Gender stereotypes">gender stereotypes</a> are damaging to individuals of both genders and thus, in 2004, she served as a mentor to the first ever all-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexual" title="Transsexual">transsexual</a> cast of <i>The Vagina Monologues</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the days before the Swedish election on September 17, 2006, Fonda went to Sweden to support the new political party <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feministiskt_initiativ" title="Feministiskt initiativ">Feministiskt initiativ</a> in their election campaign.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>My Life So Far</i>, Fonda says that she considers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchy" title="Patriarchy">patriarchy</a> to be harmful to men as well as women. She also states that for many years, she feared to call herself a feminist, because she believed that all feminists were "anti-male". But now, with her increased understanding of patriarchy, she feels that feminism is beneficial to both men and women, and states that she "still loves men". She states that when she divorced Ted Turner, she felt like she had also divorced the world of patriarchy, and was very happy to have done so.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington" title="Seattle, Washington">Seattle, Washington</a> in 1970 to support a group of Native Americans who were led by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Whitebear" title="Bernie Whitebear">Bernie Whitebear</a>.

The group was attempting to secure a land base where they could establish services for the sizable local <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Indian" title="Urban Indian">Urban Indian</a> population. Fonda went to help the endeavor because she felt "Indians had a right to part of the land that was originally all theirs." The endeavor succeeded and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daybreak_Star_Cultural_Center" title="Daybreak Star Cultural Center">Daybreak Star Cultural Center</a> was constructed in the city's Discovery Park.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 2002 Fonda visited Israel and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" title="West Bank">West Bank</a> as part of a tour focusing on stopping violence against women. She demonstrated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Black" title="Women in Black">Women in Black</a> against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip" title="Gaza Strip">Gaza Strip</a> outside the residence of Israel's Prime Minister. She later visited Jewish and Arab doctors and patients at a Jerusalem hospital, followed by visits to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramallah" title="Ramallah">Ramallah</a> to see a physical rehabilitation center, and a Palestinian refugee camp. Fonda was criticized by right-wing Israelis, and was heckled by members of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_for_Israel%27s_Tomorrow" title="Women for Israel's Tomorrow">Women for Israel's Tomorrow</a> as she arrived for a meeting with leading Israeli feminists.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September 2009, Fonda was one of over fifty signatories to a letter protesting the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Toronto_International_Film_Festival" title="2009 Toronto International Film Festival">2009 Toronto International Film Festival</a>'s presentation of ten films about the Israeli city <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" title="Tel Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>. The protest letter said that the spotlight on Tel Aviv was part of "the Israeli propaganda machine" because it was supported in part by funding from the Israeli government and had been described by the Israeli Consul General Amir Gissin as being part of a Brand Israel campaign intended to draw attention away from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict" title="Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict">Israel's conflict with the Palestinians</a>.

By calling into question the legitimacy of Tel Aviv, they are supporting a one-state solution, which means the destruction of the State of Israel." Hier continued, saying that "it is clear that the script [the protesters] are reading from might as well have been written by Hamas."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda, in a posting on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Huffington_Post" title="The Huffington Post">The Huffington Post</a></i>, said that she regretted some of the language used in the original protest letter and how it "was perhaps too easily misunderstood. It certainly has been wildly distorted. Contrary to the lies that have been circulated, the protest letter was not demonizing Israeli films and filmmakers." She continued, writing "the greatest 're-branding' of Israel would be to celebrate that country's long standing, courageous and robust peace movement by helping to end the blockade of Gaza through negotiations with all parties to the conflict, and by stopping the expansion of West Bank settlements. That's the way to show Israel's commitment to peace, not a PR campaign. There will be no two-state solution unless this happens." Fonda emphasized that she, "in no way, support[s] the destruction of Israel. I am for the two-state solution. I have been to Israel many times and love the country and its people." Several prominent Atlanta Jews subsequently signed a letter to <i>The Huffington Post</i> rejecting the vilification of Fonda, who they described as "a strong supporter and friend of Israel".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fonda has argued that the military campaign in Iraq will turn people all over the world against America, and has asserted that a global hatred of America will result in more terrorist attacks in the aftermath of the war.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film begins with the disappearance of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> executive Tom Gruneman. The police reveal that an obscene letter was found in Gruneman's office. It was addressed to a prostitute in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> named Bree Daniels (Fonda), who had received several similar letters from Gruneman. Much to the surprise of the police, Peter Cable (Cioffi), an executive at Gruneman's company, hires family friend John Klute (Sutherland) to investigate Gruneman's disappearance.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Klute rents an apartment in the basement of Daniels' building, taps her phone, and follows her as she turns tricks. Initially, Daniels appears to be liberated by the freedom of freelancing as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_girl" title="Call girl">call girl</a>. In visits with a psychiatrist throughout the film, however, she reveals that she feels empty inside and wants to quit. Klute asks Daniels to answer some of his questions, but she refuses. He approaches her again, revealing that he has been watching her. She assumes that he will turn her in if she does not cooperate, but does not recall Gruneman at all. She reveals that she was beaten by one of her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_(prostitution)" title="John (prostitution)">johns</a> two years earlier, but after seeing a photo of Gruneman, she says she cannot say for sure one way or the other. She is only certain that the john "was serious" about the attack.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daniels takes Klute to meet her former pimp, Frank Ligourin (Scheider). Ligourin reveals that one of his prostitutes passed off the abusive client to Bree and another woman named Arlyn Page (Dorothy Tristan). The original prostitute committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, and Page became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_dependence" title="Substance dependence">junkie</a> and disappeared. Klute gives his surveillance tapes to Daniels, telling her he is finished with her part of the case. But, realizing that he cannot continue the investigation without her, he re-enlists her help to track down Page.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As they search the city for the woman over several days, Klute and Daniels develop a romance. She admits to a deep <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">paranoia</a> which makes her think that she is being watched. Throughout the film, she is frequently shown from the perspective of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking" title="Stalking">stalker</a> in a building across the street.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the couple finally track down Page, she says that the "freak" (john) was not Gruneman, but an "older man". Shortly after the meeting, a boat in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Van_Kull" title="Kill Van Kull">Kill Van Kull</a> turns up Page's body, another apparent suicide. Klute deduces a connection between the two suicides of the prostitutes who have been with the mysterious abusive client, surmising that the client probably also killed Gruneman and may kill Daniels next. He revisits all of Gruneman's contacts anew, to try to find connections with the case. By typographic comparison, the supposed obscene letters of Gruneman are traced to Cable, with whom Klute has been meeting regularly to report on his investigation.</p>
