				university crew. Partly because of his great stature, the Berkeley acting coach
				spotted Peck and decided he would be perfect for university theater work. Peck then
				developed an interest in acting and was recruited by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Duerr" title="Edwin Duerr">Edwin

				five plays during his senior year. Although his tuition fee was only $26 a year,
				Peck still struggled to pay, and had to work as a "hasher" (kitchen helper) for the
				Alpha Gamma Delta sorority in exchange for meals. Peck would later say about
				Berkeley that, "it was a very special experience for me and three of the greatest
				years of my life. It woke me up and made me a human being." In 1997, he donated

				</h2>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Philip Schuyler Green (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>) is a widowed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist" title="Journalist">journalist</a> who has just moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New
						York City</a> with his son Tommy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Stockwell" title="Dean Stockwell">Dean Stockwell</a>) and mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne
						Revere</a>). Green meets with magazine publisher John Minify (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Dekker" title="Albert Dekker">Albert Dekker</a>), who asks Green to write an article
					on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism" title="Antisemitism">antisemitism</a>. After initially struggling with how
					to approach the topic in a fresh way, Green is inspired to adopt a Jewish
					identity ("Phil Greenberg") and write about his own first-hand experiences.
					Green and Minify agree to keep it secret that Phil is not actually Jewish; since
					he and his family are new to New York and know almost no one, it should be easy
					to hide.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At a dinner party, Phil meets Minify's
					divorced niece Kathy Lacey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>), who turns out to be the person who originally
					suggested the story idea. Phil and Kathy begin dating. Though she seems to have
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> views, when he reveals what he intends to do,
					she is taken aback and asks him if he actually is Jewish. The strain on their
					relationship due to Kathy's subtle acquiescence to bigotry becomes a key theme
					in the film.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the magazine, Phil is assigned a
					secretary, Elaine Wales (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Havoc" title="June Havoc">June
						Havoc</a>), who discloses to him that she too is Jewish. She changed her
					name in order to get the job (her application under her Jewish-sounding name,
					Estelle Wilovsky, was rejected). Later, after Phil informs Minify about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice" title="Prejudice">prejudice</a> Wales encountered, Minify orders the
					magazine to adopt hiring policies that are open to Jews. Wales has reservations
					about the new policy, fearing that the "wrong Jews" will be hired and ruin
					things for the few Jews working there now. Phil also befriends <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fashion" title="Fashion">fashion</a> editor Anne Dettrey (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_Holm" title="Celeste Holm">Celeste Holm</a>) who becomes a good friend and potential romantic partner,
					particularly as strains develop in Phil and Kathy's relationship.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Phil's research project proceeds, his
					childhood friend, Dave Goldman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield" title="John Garfield">John
						Garfield</a>), who is Jewish, moves to New York for a job and lives with the
					Greens while he looks for a home for his family. Housing is scarce in New York,
					but it is particularly difficult for Goldman, since not all landlords will rent
					to a Jewish family. When Phil tells Dave about his project, Dave is supportive,
					but concerned.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As time goes on, Phil experiences several
					incidents of bigotry. When his mother becomes ill with a heart condition, the
					doctor discourages him from consulting a specialist with an obviously Jewish
					name, suggesting he might be cheated by the Jewish doctor. When Phil reveals
					that he is himself Jewish, the doctor becomes uncomfortable and leaves. Also,
					when kids at school learn that Tommy is Jewish, he becomes the target of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying" title="Bullying">bullies</a>. Phil is troubled by the way Kathy consoles
					Tommy, telling him that their taunts of "dirty Jew" are wrong because he isn't
					Jewish, not that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epithet" title="Epithet">epithet</a> is
					wrong in and of itself.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kathy's attitudes are revealed further when
					she and Phil announce their engagement. Her sister Jane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyatt" title="Jane Wyatt">Jane
						Wyatt</a>) invites them to a celebration in her home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien,_Connecticut" title="Darien, Connecticut">Darien, Connecticut</a>, which is known to be a
					"restricted" community where Jews are not welcome. Fearing an awkward scene,
					Kathy wants to tell her family and friends that Phil is only pretending to be a
					Jew, but Phil prevails on Kathy to tell only Jane. At the party, everyone is
					very friendly to Phil, though many people are "unable" to attend at the last
					minute.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dave announces that he will have to quit his
					job because he cannot find a place for his family to live. Kathy owns a vacant
					cottage in Darien, but though Phil sees it as the obvious solution to Dave's
					problem, Kathy is unwilling to offend her neighbors by renting it to a Jewish
					family. As a result, she and Phil break their engagement. Phil announces that he
					will be moving away from New York when his article is published. When it comes
					out, it is very well received by the magazine staff.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kathy meets with Dave and asks him for help.
					Dave tells her that she is not antisemitic, but confronts her about times she
					has been offended by antisemitic slurs, but kept silent. He also points out that
					she might feel better speaking up. That conversation seems to be the turning
					point for Kathy. The next day, Dave tells Phil that he and his family will be
					moving into the cottage in Darien and Kathy will be moving in with her sister
					next door to make sure they are treated well by their neighbors. When Phil hears
					this, he reconciles with Kathy.</p>

				</h2>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gentleman's Agreement received a generally
					favorable reception from influential <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">New York Times</a>
					</i> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>. Crowther said that "every point about prejudice which
					Miss Hobson had to make in her book has been made with superior illustration and
					more graphic demonstration in the film, so that the sweep of her moral
					indignation is not only widened but intensified thereby."</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crowther said that the movie shared the
					novel's failings in that "explorations are narrowly confined to the upper-class
					social and professional level to which he is immediately exposed." He also said
					that the main character's shock at the extent of antisemitism was lacking in
					credibility "it is, in a careful analysis, an extraordinarily naive role."<a href="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE7DE113AE233A25751C1A9679D946693D6CF" title="http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0DE7DE113AE233A25751C1A9679D946693D6CF" rel="nofollow">[1]</a></p>
