	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>The Color of Money</b></i> is a 1984 novel by American writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Tevis" title="Walter Tevis">Walter Tevis</a>, and a 1986 film semi-adaptation by the same title. The film continues the story of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_(cue_sports)" title="Pool (cue sports)">pool</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustling" title="Hustling">hustler</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#Stake" title="Glossary of cue sports terms">stakehorse</a> Edward "Fast Eddie" Felson from Tevis' first novel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hustler_(novel)" title="The Hustler (novel)">The Hustler</a></i> (1959), with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> reprising his role from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hustler_(film)" title="The Hustler (film)">its film adaptation</a> (1961). The sequel novel and film share as their premise the continuation of Felson's story at a point more than 20 years after the events depicted in <i>The Hustler</i>, and with Eddie not having been active on the pool circuit during that time. But aside from this and the title, they have little in common. Although Tevis did author a screenplay for <i>The Color of Money</i> that was based on his novel, the filmmakers ultimately decided not to use Tevis's story at all, and instead crafted an entirely different one for the movie, one with a large number of plot-point similarities to the earlier 1980 pool comedy, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Baltimore_Bullet" title="The Baltimore Bullet">The Baltimore Bullet</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The title is a reference to the traditional green cloth (or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baize" title="Baize">baize</a>) of a pool table being reminiscent of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">American currency notes</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to Newman, the film also stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> as Fast Eddie's protegÃ© and rival Vincent Lauria, plus <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Elizabeth_Mastrantonio" title="Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio">Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Shaver" title="Helen Shaver">Helen Shaver</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Turturro" title="John Turturro">John Turturro</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the book version of the sequel, Felson is no longer a professional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_billiards" title="Pocket billiards">pool</a> player, but now owns a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_hall" title="Pool hall">pool hall</a>. He takes up a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#.23Cue" title="Glossary of cue sports terms">cue</a> again to go on tour versus Minnesota Fatsâ€”the fictional character from <i>The Hustler</i>, not the real-life <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Wanderone_Jr." title="Rudolph Wanderone Jr.">Rudolph "Minnesota Fats" Wanderone</a> -- for a cable TV sports show. Eddie finds he must cope with becoming skilled at the now-prevalent game of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-ball" title="Nine-ball">nine-ball</a>, as opposed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_pool" title="Straight pool">straight pool</a>, which he had mastered decades earlier. While losing to Fats, he regains some of his lost competitiveness and pride.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the film version, Felson is a liquor salesman. He misses the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#.23Action" title="Glossary of cue sports terms">action</a> and goes back on the road as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#Stake" title="Glossary of cue sports terms">stakehorse</a> for a skilled but unfocused <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentorship" title="Mentorship">protÃ©gÃ©</a>, Vincent, travelling with the latter's manipulative girlfriend, Carmen. Eddie teaches them how to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hustling" title="Hustling">hustle</a> significant amounts of money. But he also becomes increasingly frustrated with them and with himself, until an explosive falling-out results in a parting of the ways.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director Scorsese has a cameo walking his dog, and another playing pool. Newman said that the best advice he was given by Scorsese was to "try <i>not</i> to be funny". Cruise performed most of his own shots. An exception was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_cue_sports_terms#Jump_shot" title="Glossary of cue sports terms">jump shot</a> over two balls to sink another. Scorsese believed Cruise could learn the shot, but that it would take too long, so the shot was performed for him by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sigel" title="Mike Sigel">Mike Sigel</a>. The "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Balabushka" title="George Balabushka">Balabushka</a>" cue in the movie was actually a Joss J-18, which later became the Joss N-07 (not a Meucci as many believe), made to resemble a classic Balabushka.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many top American pool players of the 1980s had speaking roles, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Mizerak" title="Steve Mizerak">Steve Mizerak</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Mathews" title="Grady Mathews">Grady Mathews</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_McCready" title="Keith McCready">Keith McCready</a>, and there were many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameos</a>, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Mataya" title="Jimmy Mataya">Jimmy Mataya</a>, Howard Vickery, Mark Jarvis and Louie Roberts.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another notable cameo is that of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iggy_Pop" title="Iggy Pop">Iggy Pop</a>, who plays one of the many contenders on the road. A young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker" title="Forest Whitaker">Forest Whitaker</a> makes an extended cameo appearance as a pool hustler as well.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Noticeably absent from the film incarnation of<i>The Color of Money</i> is the Minnesota Fats character, which had been so memorably portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> in <i>The Hustler</i>. Newman later said that he had wanted the character to appear, but that none of the attempts to include him fit well into the story that was being written. According to Scorsese, Gleason apparently agreed with Newman's opinion that Minnesota Fats was adventitious to the film's story. Scorsese said that Gleason was presented a draft of the script that had Fats worked into the narrative, but that upon reading it, Gleason declined to reprise the role because he felt that the character seemed to have been added as "an afterthought".</p>
