      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Paul Muni</b> (September 22, 1895 â€“ August 25, 1967) was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria-Hungary" title="Austria-Hungary">Austrian-Hungarian</a>-born American stage and film actor. During the 1930s, he was considered the most prestigious actor at Warner Brothers studios, and one of the rare actors who was given the privilege of choosing which parts he wanted.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His acting quality, usually playing a powerful character, such as <i>Scarface</i>, was partly a result of his intense preparation for his parts, often immersing himself in study of the real character's traits and mannerisms. He was also highly skilled in using makeup techniques, a talent he learned from his parents, who were also actors, and from his early years on stage with the Yiddish Theater, in New York. At the age of 12, he played the stage role of an 80-year-old man; in one of his films, <i>Seven Faces</i>, he played seven different characters.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He has been nominated six times for an Oscar, winning once as Best Actor in <i>The Story of Louis Pasteur</i>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was born <b>Meshilem Meier Weisenfreund</b> to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Jewish" title="Polish Jewish">Polish Jewish</a> family in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemberg" title="Lemberg">Lemberg</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galicia_(Central_Europe)" title="Galicia (Central Europe)">Galicia</a>, a province of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austro-Hungarian_Empire" title="Austro-Hungarian Empire">Austro-Hungarian Empire</a>, now <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lviv,_Ukraine" title="Lviv, Ukraine">Lviv, Ukraine</a> (formerly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lw%C3%B3w" title="LwÃ³w">LwÃ³w</a>, Poland). His family emigrated to the United States in 1902.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He began his acting career on the Yiddish stage in New York City, where his parents were actors with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish_theatre" title="Yiddish theatre">Yiddish theatre</a>. As a teenager, he developed an affinity for makeup and often played characters much older. Film historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Osborne" title="Robert Osborne">Robert Osborne</a> notes that his makeup skills were so creative, that for most of his roles, "he transformed his appearance so completely, he was dubbed 'the New <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney,_Jr." title="Lon Chaney, Jr.">Lon Chaney</a>.' In his first stage role, at the age of 12, he played the role of an eighty-year-old man.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was quickly recognized by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Schwartz" title="Maurice Schwartz">Maurice Schwartz</a>, who signed him up with his Yiddish Art Theater. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a> and Paul Muni were cousins to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Charles_M._Fritz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Charles M. Fritz (page does not exist)">Charles M. Fritz</a>, who was a notable actor during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. In 1921, he married Bella Finkel (February 8, 1898 - October 1, 1971), an actress in the Yiddish theatre. They remained married until Muni's death in 1967.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 1925 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> article singled out his and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Kasten" title="Sam Kasten">Sam Kasten</a>'s performances at the People's Theater as among the highlights of that year's Yiddish theater season, describing them as second only to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Satz" title="Ludwig Satz">Ludwig Satz</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Broadway_and_Hollywood">Broadway and Hollywood</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Muni began acting on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> in 1926. His first role was that of an elderly Jewish man in the play <i>We Americans</i>, written by playwrights Max Siegel and Milton Herbert Gropper; it was also the first time that he ever acted in English. He was signed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Film_Corporation" title="Fox Film Corporation">Fox</a> three years later, in 1929, and received an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> nomination for his first film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Valiant_(1929_film)" title="The Valiant (1929 film)">The Valiant</a></i>, although the film did poorly at the box office. His second film, <i>Seven Faces</i>, was also a financial failure. Unhappy with the roles offered him, he returned to Broadway, where he starred in a major hit play, <i>Counselor at Law</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1932, Paul Muni returned to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> to star in such harrowing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code" title="Pre-Code">pre-Code</a> films as the original <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1932_film)" title="Scarface (1932 film)">Scarface</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_a_Fugitive_from_a_Chain_Gang" title="I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang">I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</a></i>, for which he received his second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> nomination for Best Actor. The acclaim that Muni received as a result of this performances so impressed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers_Studios" title="Warner Brothers Studios">Warner Brothers</a>, they signed him to a long-term contract, "publicizing him as the screen's greatest actor."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Scarface</i>, also became one of Hollywood's first major gangster films, and was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>, a leading screenwriter. The film, notes critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Corliss" title="Richard Corliss">Richard Corliss</a>, while a serious gangster film, also "manages both to congratulate journalism for its importance and to chastise it for its chicanery, by underlining the newspapers' complicity in promoting the underworld image."   The film won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Original_Screenplay" title="Best Original Screenplay">Best Original Screenplay</a> - the first year the awards were presented.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1935, Muni convinced Warner Bros. to take a financial risk by producing its first historical biography, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Story_of_Louis_Pasteur" title="The Story of Louis Pasteur">The Story of Louis Pasteur</a></i>. This became Muni's first of many later biographical roles, and in it he starred as a crusading scientist who fights derision in his native country to prove that his medical theories will save lives. Until that film, most Warner Bros. stories originated from current events and major news stories.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the sudden success of the film, it gave Warners "box office gold", notes Osborne. Muni won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> for his performance. He then went on to play other historical figures, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emile_Zola" title="Emile Zola">Emile Zola</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Life_of_Emile_Zola" title="The Life of Emile Zola">The Life of Emile Zola</a></i> (1937) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juarez_(1939_film)" title="Juarez (1939 film)">Juarez</a> (1939).</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1937, he played the starring role as a Chinese peasant, with a new bride, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Earth_(film)" title="The Good Earth (film)"><i>The Good Earth</i></a>. It costarred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luise_Rainer" title="Luise Rainer">Luise Rainer</a> as his humble wife, who won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for her part. The film was a re-creation of a revolutionary period in China, and included special effects for a locust attack and the overthrow of the government. It was based on the classic novel, by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Buck" title="Pearl Buck">Pearl Buck</a>, of the same name. Because he was not of Asian descent, when producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> offered him the role, he stated, "I'm about as Chinese as Herbert Hoover."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dissatisfied with life in Hollywood, Muni chose not to renew his contract, and returned to the screen only occasionally for such roles as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Chopin" title="Frederick Chopin">Frederick Chopin</a>'s teacher in <i>A Song to Remember</i> (1945). In 1946, he starred in a rare comic performance, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_on_My_Shoulder_(film)" title="Angel on My Shoulder (film)">Angel on My Shoulder</a></i>, playing a gangster whose early death prompts the Devil (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</a>) to make mischief by putting his soul into the body of a judge, only to have his new identity turn the former criminal into a model citizen.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, he focused most of his energies on stage work. Also in 1946, he appeared on Broadway in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Flag_is_Born" title="A Flag is Born">A Flag is Born</a></i>, also written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a>, to help promote the creation of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> state in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel" title="Israel">Israel</a>. Ten years later, in 1956, he had his biggest stage success as the crusading lawyer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Henry_Drummond_(fictional_character)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Henry Drummond (fictional character) (page does not exist)">Henry Drummond</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherit_the_Wind_(play)" title="Inherit the Wind (play)">Inherit the Wind</a></i>, winning a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award_for_Best_Performance_by_a_Leading_Actor_in_a_Play" title="Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play">Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After one more film role as an aging doctor in <i>The Last Angry Man</i> (1959), for which he was again nominated for an Oscar, his failing eyesight and other health problems forced him to retire from acting. Muni was nominated six times for Academy Awards, winning once, although he appeared in only twenty-five films during his career.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Muni was noted for his intense preparation for his roles, especially his biographies. While preparing for <i>The Story of Louis Pasteur</i>, Muni states that "I read most everything that was in the library, and everything I could lay my hands on that had to do with Pasteur, with Lister, or with his contemporaries." He did the same in preparing for his role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Drummond" title="Henry Drummond">Henry Drummond</a>, in the stage production of <i>Inherit the Wind</i>. He read what he could find, talked to people who knew Darrow personally, and even studied mannerisms from his photographs. "To Paul Muni, acting was not just a career, but an obsession", writes the <i>New York Times</i>. They note that despite his enormous success on both Broadway and in films, "he threw himself into each role with a sense of dedication." Playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a> commented that Muni "was pursued by a fear of failure."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Muni was born into a theater atmosphere, with both of his parents actors, "he learned his craft carefully and thoroughly." On stage, "a Muni whisper could reach the last balcony of any theater", writes the <i>Times</i>. It adds that his style "had drawn into it the warmth of the Yiddish stage", in which he made his debut at the age of 12. In addition, his techique in using makeup "was a work of art." Combined with acting which followed no "method", he perfected his control of voice and gestures into an acting style that was "unique."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Shipman_(author)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Shipman (author) (page does not exist)">David Shipman</a> called Muni "an actor of great integrity" and he prepared for his roles meticulously. Muni was widely recognized as an eccentric if talented individual. He would go into a rage whenever anyone wore red, but at the same time he could often be found between sessions relaxing with his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin" title="Violin">violin</a>. Over the years, he also became increasingly dependent on his wife, Bella, who terrified directors by forcing them to redo scenes that did not meet her satisfaction. However, Muni himself was "inflexible on matters of taste and principle", once turning down an $800,000 movie contract because he wasn't happy with the studio's choice of film roles.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He retired from filmmaking in 1959, soon after receiving his fifth Academy Award nomination for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Angry_Man" title="The Last Angry Man">The Last Angry Man</a></i>; however, he made a final television appearance in the series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Saints_and_Sinners_(1962_series)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Saints and Sinners (1962 series) (page does not exist)">Saints and Sinners</a></i> in 1962.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his private life, he was considered "exceedingly shy", and would show agony anytime he was recognized while out shopping or dining. He enjoyed reading and going for walks with his wife in secluded sections of Central Park, and would be at the theater by 7:30PM to prepare for his performances each night. After retiring from acting, he lived in California, in what was considered an "austere" setting, where he and his wife enjoyed their privacy. In his den, which he called his "Shangri-La", he spent his time reading books and listening to the radio.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Muni died of a heart disorder in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecito,_California" title="Montecito, California">Montecito, California</a> in 1967, aged 71. Muni died the same year that his <i>Angel On My Shoulder</i> co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</a>, and another co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, also died.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sergeant James Allen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Muni" title="Paul Muni">Paul Muni</a>) returns to civilian life after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> but has a hard time finding work. He accidentally becomes caught up in a robbery and is sentenced to ten years on a brutal Southern chain gang.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He escapes and makes his way to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, where he becomes a success in the construction business. He becomes involved with the proprietor of his boardinghouse, Marie Woods (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenda_Farrell" title="Glenda Farrell">Glenda Farrell</a>), who discovers his secret and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmails</a> him into an unhappy marriage. He then meets and falls in love with Helen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Vinson" title="Helen Vinson">Helen Vinson</a>). When he asks his wife for a divorce, she betrays him to the authorities. He is offered a pardon if he will turn himself in; Allen accepts, only to find that it was just a ruse. He escapes once again.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the end, Allen visits Helen in the shadows on the street and tells her he is leaving forever. She asks, "Can't you tell me where you're going? Will you write? Do you need any money?" James repeatedly shakes his head in answer as he backs away. Finally Helen says, "But you must, Jim. How do you live?" In the film's final line and shot James, unseen in the darkness, replies, "I steal." The line is among the most famous closing lines in American film. LeRoy later claimed that the idea for James' retreat into darkness came to him when a fuse blew on the set, but in fact it was written into the script.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Audiences in the United States who saw the film began to question the legitimacy of the United States legal system, and January 1933 the film's protagonist, Robert Elliot Burns, who was still imprisoned in New Jersey, and a number of different chain gang prisoners nationwide in the United States were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy, who was also made into a character in the film, sued the studio for displaying "vicious, brutal and false attacks" against him in the film.</p>
