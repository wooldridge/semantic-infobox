	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nicholson was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Vincent%27s_Hospital_(Manhattan)" title="St. Vincent's Hospital (Manhattan)">St. Vincent's Hospital</a> in New York City, the son of a showgirl, June Frances Nicholson (stage name June Nilson). June had married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> showman Donald Furcillo (stage name Donald Rose) six months earlier in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elkton,_Maryland" title="Elkton, Maryland">Elkton, Maryland</a>, on October 16, 1936. Elkton was a town known for its "quickie" marriages. Furcillo, however, was already married, and, although he offered to take care of the child, June's mother Ethel insisted that she bring up the baby, partly so that June could pursue her dancing career. Although Donald Furcillo claimed to be Nicholson's father and to have committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigamy" title="Bigamy">bigamy</a> by marrying June, biographer Patrick McGilligan asserted in <i>Jack's Life</i> that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latvian_people" title="Latvian people">Latvian</a>-born Eddie King (originally Edgar A. Kirschfeld), June's manager, may be the father, and other sources have suggested that June Nicholson was unsure of who the father was. Nicholson's mother was of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_American" title="Irish American">Irish</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_American" title="English American">English</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_American" title="Dutch American">Dutch</a> descent though he and his family self-identified as Irish.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nicholson was brought up believing that his grandparents, John Joseph Nicholson (a department store window dresser in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasquan,_New_Jersey" title="Manasquan, New Jersey">Manasquan</a>, New Jersey) and Ethel May Rhoads (a hairdresser, beautician and amateur artist in Manasquan), were his parents. Nicholson only discovered that his "parents" were actually his grandparents and his sister was in fact his mother in 1974, after a journalist for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine who was doing a feature on Nicholson informed him of the fact. By this time, both his mother and grandmother had died (in 1963 and 1970, respectively). Nicholson has stated he does not know who his father is, saying "Only Ethel and June knew and they never told anybody", and has chosen not to have a DNA test or to pursue the matter.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nicholson grew up in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune_City,_New_Jersey" title="Neptune City, New Jersey">Neptune City, New Jersey</a>. He was raised in his mother's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a> religion. "Nick", as he was known to his high school friends, attended nearby <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasquan_High_School" title="Manasquan High School">Manasquan High School</a>, where he was voted "class clown" by the Class of 1954. A theatre and a drama award at the school are named in his honor. In 2004, Nicholson attended his 50-year <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_reunion" title="High school reunion">high school reunion</a> accompanied by his aunt Lorraine.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Nicholson first came to Hollywood, he worked as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gofer" title="Gofer">gofer</a> for animation legends <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hanna" title="William Hanna">William Hanna</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Barbera" title="Joseph Barbera">Joseph Barbera</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer_cartoon_studio" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio">MGM cartoon studio</a>. Seeing his talent as an artist, they offered Nicholson a starting level position as an animation artist. However, citing his desire to become an actor, he declined.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He made his film debut in a low-budget teen drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cry_Baby_Killer" title="The Cry Baby Killer">The Cry Baby Killer</a></i>, in 1958, playing the title role. For the following decade, Nicholson was a frequent collaborator with the film's producer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman" title="Roger Corman">Roger Corman</a>. Corman directed Nicholson on several occasions, most notably in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Shop_of_Horrors" title="The Little Shop of Horrors">The Little Shop of Horrors</a></i>, as masochistic dental patient Wilbur Force, and also in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Raven_(1963_film)" title="The Raven (1963 film)">The Raven</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terror_(1963_film)" title="The Terror (1963 film)">The Terror</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_St._Valentine%27s_Day_Massacre" title="The St. Valentine's Day Massacre">The St. Valentine's Day Massacre</a></i>. He worked frequently with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Hellman" title="Monte Hellman">Monte Hellman</a> as well on low-budget westerns, though two in particular, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ride_in_the_Whirlwind" title="Ride in the Whirlwind">Ride in the Whirlwind</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shooting" title="The Shooting">The Shooting</a></i>, initially failed to find interest from any US film distributors but gained cult success on the art house circuit in France and were later sold to television.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><span class="mw-headline" id="Rise_to_fame">Rise to fame</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With his acting career heading nowhere, Nicholson seemed resigned to a career behind the camera as a writer/director. His first real taste of writing success was the LSD-fueled screenplay for 1967's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trip_(1967_film)" title="The Trip (1967 film)">The Trip</a></i> (directed by Corman), which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Fonda" title="Peter Fonda">Peter Fonda</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a>. Nicholson also co-wrote, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Rafelson" title="Bob Rafelson">Bob Rafelson</a>, the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_(film)" title="Head (film)">Head</a></i>, which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees" title="The Monkees">The Monkees</a>. In addition, he also arranged the movie's soundtrack. However, after a spot opened up in Fonda and Hopper's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider" title="Easy Rider">Easy Rider</a></i>, it led to his first big acting break. Nicholson played hard-drinking lawyer George Hanson, for which he received his first Oscar nomination. The part of Hanson was a lucky break for Nicholsonâ€”the role had in fact been written for actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Torn" title="Rip Torn">Rip Torn</a>, who was a close friend of screen writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Southern" title="Terry Southern">Terry Southern</a>, but Torn withdrew from the project after a bitter argument with the film's director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a>, during which the two men almost came to blows.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A Best Actor nomination came the following year for his persona-defining role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Easy_Pieces" title="Five Easy Pieces">Five Easy Pieces</a></i> (1970). Also that year, he appeared in the movie adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_a_Clear_Day_You_Can_See_Forever_(film)" title="On a Clear Day You Can See Forever (film)">On A Clear Day You Can See Forever</a></i>, although most of his performance was left on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_room_floor" title="Cutting room floor">cutting room floor</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other Nicholson roles included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Ashby" title="Hal Ashby">Hal Ashby</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Detail" title="The Last Detail">The Last Detail</a></i> (1973), for which he was awarded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prix_d%27interpr%C3%A9tation_masculine" title="Prix d'interprÃ©tation masculine">Best Actor</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>, and the classic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski</a> noir thriller, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(film)" title="Chinatown (film)">Chinatown</a></i> (1974). Nicholson was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for both films.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After this, he began to take more unusual roles.
