      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1959, Landau made his first major film appearance in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest" title="North by Northwest">North by Northwest</a></i> at the age of 31.

According to <i>The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier,</i> by Patrick J. White (Avon Books, 1991), Landau initially declined to be contracted to the show as he did not want it to interfere with his film career; instead, for the first season he was credited in "special guest appearances by" him. He became a "full-time" cast member with the second season, although the studio agreed to only contract him on a year-by-year basis rather than the then-standard five years. The role of Rollin Hand required Landau to perform a wide range of accents and characters from dictators to thugs, and several episodes saw Landau playing dual roles - not only Hand's impersonation, but also the person Hand is impersonating. He co-starred in the series with his then wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bain" title="Barbara Bain">Barbara Bain</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid-1970s, Landau and Bain, teamed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Morse" title="Barry Morse">Barry Morse</a>, returned to television in the British science fiction series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space:_1999" title="Space: 1999">Space: 1999</a></i>, produced first by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerry_Anderson" title="Gerry Anderson">Gerry Anderson</a> in partnership with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Anderson" title="Sylvia Anderson">Sylvia Anderson</a> and then by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Freiberger" title="Fred Freiberger">Fred Freiberger</a>. Although it remains a cult classic for its high production design values, the series was critically derided during its run and was cancelled after two seasons. Landau himself became very critical of the show's scripts and storylines, especially during its second season, but praised the cast and crew. He wrote forewords for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Morse" title="Barry Morse">Barry Morse</a>'s 2006 theatrical memoir <i>Remember With Advantages</i> and for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Smith_(writer)" title="Jim Smith (writer)">Jim Smith</a>'s critical biography of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a>.</p>

This was the last time the two acted together on screen, as of December 2007.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the late 1980s, Landau staged a major career comeback by winning an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for his role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker:_The_Man_and_His_Dream" title="Tucker: The Man and His Dream">Tucker: The Man and His Dream</a></i>. He later received a second nomination for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a></i> and won the 1994 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> for his uncanny portrayal of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bela_Lugosi" title="Bela Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Wood_(film)" title="Ed Wood (film)">Ed Wood</a>.</i> Upon accepting the award, he was visibly frustrated by the orchestra's attempt to cut short his speech. When the music level rose, he pounded his fist on the podium and yelled "No!" He later stated that he had intended to thank Lugosi and dedicate the award to him and his frustration was that he did not get to mention the man whom he portrayed. Landau received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild_Award" title="Screen Actors Guild Award">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a>, and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_Award" title="Saturn Award">Saturn Award</a> for the role, as well as awards from several critics groups. When Landau won the Academy Award, a reporter for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> said that "the award goes to Martin Landau; its shadow goes to Bela Lugosi." Landau admitted, on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Wood_(film)" title="Ed Wood (film)">Ed Wood</a></i> DVD, to having been very impressed by the comment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, Landau made a guest appearance on the TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entourage_(TV_series)" title="Entourage (TV series)">Entourage</a>,</i> playing a washed-up, but determined and sympathetic, Hollywood producer attempting to relive his glory days. Landau received a 2007 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for his performance in this role.</p>

Tucker's dream of manufacturing a revolutionary automobile with futuristic features will pit him against the oppressive Detroit-based Big Three automakers. With the support of his long-time New York financier Abe Karatz (Martin Landau), Tucker creates nation-wide interest by advertising the "Tucker Torpedo" in <i>Pic</i> magazine. Raising the money through a stock issue, Tucker and Karatz purchase the enormous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Chicago_Plant" title="Dodge Chicago Plant">Dodge Chicago Plant</a> to begin manufacturing. Despite ground-breaking features on the first hand-built prototype such as disc brakes, seat belts, a fuel-injected engine in the rear, a padded dashboard, and a front windshield that pops out in severe collisions, the new car is beset with problems.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From childhood, Coppola envisioned a film about the Tucker automobile and while attending the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCLA_School_of_Theater,_Film_and_Television" title="UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television">UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television</a> in the early 1960s, further refined a film concept based on the life of Preston Tucker. In June 1973, during the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i> (1974), Coppola announced his intention to start development at American Zoetrope as writer, producer and director. He had already approached Marlon Brando for the lead role. He then purchased the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_rights" title="Life rights">rights</a> from the Tucker Estate in 1976, and, in addition to Brando, discussed the leading role with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> and also considered <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Reynolds" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>. Taking inspiration from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> (1941), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki" title="Kabuki">Kabuki</a> theater and the work of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" title="Bertolt Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a>, Coppola initially planned to make <i>Tucker</i> as a "dark kind of musical."

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The musical would have featured Tucker predominantly, but storylines would have interwoven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Samuel_Firestone" title="Harvey Samuel Firestone">Harvey Samuel Firestone</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Carnegie" title="Andrew Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a> as supporting characters. Leonard Bernstein agreed to write the music, and Betty Comden and Adolph Green were hired to write the lyrics.

Coppola also approached <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Kelly" title="Gene Kelly">Gene Kelly</a> as a consultant for the dance choreography. However, financing for <i>Tucker</i> fell through when Coppola's production company, American Zoetrope, filed for bankruptcy after the box office failures of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_from_the_Heart" title="One from the Heart">One from the Heart</a></i> (1982) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cotton_Club_(film)" title="The Cotton Club (film)">The Cotton Club</a></i> (1984).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1986, during the production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_EO" title="Captain EO">Captain EO</a></i> (1986), Coppola's friend George Lucas encouraged him to revive development for <i>Tucker</i>, believing it to be "the best film Francis had ever been involved with." In addition, Lucas agreed to serve as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_producer" title="Executive producer">executive producer</a> and offered the use of his filmmaking companies, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucasfilm" title="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic" title="Industrial Light &amp; Magic">Industrial Light &amp; Magic</a>.

Coppola became interested in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</a> aspect of the storyline, as well as post-World War II capitalism and politics. At one point, Coppola approached Capra to produce the film with Lucas, however, Capra thought Tucker was a failure and Coppola dropped that plan.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola originally intended to write the screenplay himself, but due to his commitment to the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gardens_of_Stone" title="Gardens of Stone">Gardens of Stone</a></i> (1987), engaged <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schulman" title="Arnold Schulman">Arnold Schulman</a> who scripted Capra's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hole_in_the_Head" title="A Hole in the Head">A Hole in the Head</a></i> (1959). Schulman eventually collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Seidler" title="David Seidler">David Seidler</a> on the <i>Tucker</i> project.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jeff Bridges was cast in the title role and, for research, studied Preston Tucker's mannerisms and movements through home movies. Tucker's descendants also granted Bridges the opportunity to sport the man's black pearl ring and cuff links for his wardrobe. Preston's son, John Tucker, said that Bridges has "got it all in the mannerisms and the look. My father was very positive, always thinking of what came next. Jeff captures that." Martin Landau was enthusiastic about accepting the pivotal role of Abe Karatz as a means to avoid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting_(acting)" title="Typecasting (acting)">typecasting</a>. The construct of family values played a crucial role in the Tucker's life and Coppola studiously selected Joan Allen for the part of Vera, Tucker's devoted wife while Christian Slater and Elias Koteas fill in the other central roles of eldest son and Tucker's friend and confederate, Alex Tremulis. Coppola's family was undergoing a stressful time during the production and he dedicated the film to Gio, his eldest son, who died before filming began.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal photography commenced on April 13, 1987 with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company_Assembly_Plant" title="Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant">Ford Motor Company Assembly Plant</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond,_California" title="Richmond, California">Richmond, California</a> doubling for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_Chicago_Plant" title="Dodge Chicago Plant">Dodge Chicago Plant</a> although the majority of outdoor filming took place in Marin County, California as well as various locations including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novato,_California" title="Novato, California">Novato</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a>. Forty-seven of the original 52 Tucker Torpedoes still exist, and many are in excellent condition.

Production wrapped on July 17, 1987, and in the following month, Lucas convinced Paramount Pictures to distribute the film and cover the majority of the budget. He was helped by the fact that the studio was courting Coppola to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III" title="The Godfather Part III">The Godfather Part III</a></i> (1990). Prior to final editing, the studio insisted on amplifying the title to <i>Tucker: The Man and His Dream</i>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Historical_accuracy">Historical accuracy</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Coppola had a certain amount of personal affinity with the short-lived legacy of Preston Tucker. His father, Carmine Coppola had been one of the original investors in Tucker stock and purchased one of the cars off the production line. Coppola included the involvement of Preston Tucker's children, grandchildren and members of the Tucker Estate during the development of <i>Tucker</i> in the late-1970s, as well as during filming in 1987. Coppola and Lucas acknowledged that they purposely intended to portray Tucker in an entirely sympathetic way. Both filmmakers each owned two Tuckers, although Lucas eventually sold one of his cars in September 2005 for $385,500. The Tucker Automobile Club made up of a legion of Tucker owners and collectors pronounced in their trade journal, <i>TACA</i>, that the "basic theme of the movie is quite accurate..." although "the film compresses time and often takes artistic license with facts in order to more effectively present the story."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, spoke of the historical inaccuracies. "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who know the story will find a lot of what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. "We knew the facts," she continued, "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." Alex Tremulis who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan. An article on the authenticity of the movie can be found at the Tucker Car Club of America website at: <a href="http://www.tuckerclub.org/html/movieinfo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuckerclub.org/html/movieinfo.html</a></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical reaction was mainly positive.

He also believed the role of Preston Tucker to be Jeff Bridges' best performance. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin" title="Janet Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> agreed, writing that Coppola, known for his dark approach on his previous films, "found the directorial range to actually make a feel-good movie." In addition, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desson_Thomson" title="Desson Thomson">Desson Thomson</a>, writing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>, called the film a "satisfying commercial breakthrough for Coppola," and praised the cinematography of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vittorio_Storaro" title="Vittorio Storaro">Vittorio Storaro</a>, as well as the ubiquitous approach for Dean Stockwell's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearance</a> as Howard Hughes. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave a mixed review. "Preston Tucker lacks an ounce of common sense or any notion of the real odds against him. And since the movie never really deals with that - never really comes to grips with Tucker's character - it begins as a saga but ends in whimsy."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Coppola enjoyed his working relationship with Lucas, he commented in a July 1988 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lindsey_(journalist)" title="Robert Lindsey (journalist)">Robert Lindsey</a> that "I think it's a good movie - it's eccentric, a little wacky, like the Tucker car - but it's not the movie I would have made at the height of my power." Coppola was able to stoically accept the critical and commercial reaction to <i>Tucker: The Man and His Dream</i>. "Every time in my career I tried to make, dare I say it, an art film, it never did well."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite helming his "labor of love," Coppola was insistent that <i>Tucker: The Man and His Dream</i> would be his last Hollywood project. He reiterated a long-held dream of his own, embarking on a "period of amateurism and experimentation as a Hollywood dropout." One of the unexpected benefits of the film's release was a renewed interest in the Tucker automobile and a boost in the collector's value of the Tucker 48; a recent auction of a low-mileage example topped the $1 million mark.</p>
