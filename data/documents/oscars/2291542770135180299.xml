      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bickford was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts" title="Cambridge, Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, during the first minute of 1891. The fifth of seven children, he was a very independent and unruly child who was tried and acquitted at nine years old of the attempted murder of a trolley motorman who had callously driven over and killed his dog. In his late teens he drifted aimlessly around the United States for a time. Before breaking into acting, worked as a lumberjack, investment promoter, and for a short time, ran a pest extermination business. He was a stoker and fireman in the United States Navy when a friend dared him to get a job in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burlesque" title="Burlesque">Burlesque</a>. He did and remained on stage for the next sixteen years.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bickford had intended to attend the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> to earn an engineering degree, but while wandering the country, he became friends with the manager of a burlesque show, who convinced Bickford to take a role in the show. He debuted in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a> in 1911. Bickford enjoyed himself so much that he abandoned his plans to attend M.I.T. He made his legitimate stage debut with the John Craig Stock Company at the Castle Square Theatre in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston,_Massachusetts" title="Boston, Massachusetts">Boston</a> in 1912. Bickford eventually joined a road company and traveled throughout the United States for more than a decade, appearing in various productions. In 1925, while working in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> play called <i>Outside Looking In</i>, he and co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cagney" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a> (in his first Broadway role) received rave reviews. He was offered a role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Brenon" title="Herbert Brenon">Herbert Brenon</a>'s 1926 film of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Geste" title="Beau Geste">Beau Geste</a></i>, but anxious not to give up his new-found Broadway stardom, turned it down. Following a <i>succÃ¨s d'estime</i> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Anderson" title="Maxwell Anderson">Maxwell Anderson</a>-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harold_Hickerson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Harold Hickerson (page does not exist)">Harold Hickerson</a> drama about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacco_and_Vanzetti" title="Sacco and Vanzetti">Sacco and Vanzetti</a> case, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gods_of_the_Lightning&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Gods of the Lightning (page does not exist)">Gods of the Lightning</a></i> (Bickford was the Sacco character), Bickford was contacted by legendary filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille" title="Cecil B. DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> and offered a contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a> studios to star in DeMille's first talking picture, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_(film)" title="Dynamite (film)">Dynamite</a></i>. He soon began working with MGM head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> on a number of projects.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He became a star after playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>'s lover in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Christie_(1930_film)" title="Anna Christie (1930 film)">Anna Christie</a></i> (1930), but never developed into a romantic lead. Always of independent mind, strong-willed and quick with his fists, Bickford would frequently argue and nearly come to blows with Mayer. During the production of DeMille's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamite_(film)" title="Dynamite (film)">Dynamite</a></i>, he punched out his director. He rejected numerous scripts and made no secret of his disdain for much of the material he was offered. His association with MGM was short-lived, and Bickford asked for and received a release from his contract, but found himself blacklisted at other studios. He became an independent actor for several years. Bickford was mauled by a lion and nearly died while filming <i>East of Java</i> in 1935. While he recovered, he lost his contract with Fox as well as his leading man status due to extensive neck scarring coupled with his advancing age. Much preferring the character roles that now became his forte, Bickford appeared in many notable films including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer%27s_Daughter_(1947_film)" title="The Farmer's Daughter (1947 film)">The Farmer's Daughter</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Belinda_(1948_film)" title="Johnny Belinda (1948 film)">Johnny Belinda</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Star_is_Born_(1954_film)" title="A Star is Born (1954 film)">A Star is Born</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_As_a_Stranger" title="Not As a Stranger">Not As a Stranger</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bickford found his greatest success playing character actor roles, both in films and later in television. He became highly sought after; his burly frame and craggy, intense features, coupled with a gruff, powerful voice lent themselves to a wide variety of roles. Most often he played lovable father figures, stern businessmen, heavies, ship captains or authority figures of some sort. During the 1940s, he was nominated three times for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (a fact he leaves out of his autobiography). He served as host of the 1950s television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Behind_the_Badge" title="The Man Behind the Badge">The Man Behind the Badge</a></i>. He continued to act in generally prestigious projects right up until his death. He guest starred in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barbara_Stanwyck_Show" title="The Barbara Stanwyck Show">The Barbara Stanwyck Show</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eleventh_Hour_(1962_TV_series)" title="The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)">The Eleventh Hour</a></i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_drama" title="Medical drama">medical drama</a>. In his final years, Bickford played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rancher" title="Rancher">rancher</a> John Grainger, owner of the Shiloh Ranch on NBC's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian_(TV_series)" title="The Virginian (TV series)">The Virginian</a></i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a> series.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1965, he published his autobiography, <i>Bulls Balls Bicycles &amp; Actors</i>.</p>

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Story">Story</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Francois Soubirous (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Bohnen" title="Roman Bohnen">Roman Bohnen</a>), a former miller now unemployed, is forced to live at the city jail with his wife (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a>), his two sons, and his two daughters. One morning he goes to find work, and is told to take the contaminated trash from the hospital and dump it in the cave at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes" title="Lourdes">Lourdes</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the Catholic school which she and her sisters attend, fourteen-year old Bernadette Soubirous (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jones" title="Jennifer Jones">Jennifer Jones</a>) is shamed in front of the class by Sister Vazous, the teacher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladys_Cooper" title="Gladys Cooper">Gladys Cooper</a>), for not having learned her (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism" title="Catechism">catechism</a>) well. AbbÃ© Peyramale (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bickford" title="Charles Bickford">Charles Bickford</a>) enters and awards the students holy cards, but is told by Sister Vazous that Bernadette does not deserve one, because she has not studied, and that it would not be fair to the other students. Peyramale encourages Bernadette to study harder.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that afternoon, on an errand with her sister Marie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ermadean_Walters&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Ermadean Walters (page does not exist)">Ermadean Walters</a>) and school friend Jeanne (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anderson_(film_actress)" title="Mary Anderson (film actress)">Mary Anderson</a>) to collect firewood outside the town of Lourdes, Bernadette is left behind when her companions warn her not to wade through the cold river by the Massabielle caves for fear of taking ill. About to cross anyway, Bernadette is distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light. Investigating the cave, she finds a beautiful lady standing in brilliant light, holding a pearl rosary. She tells her sister and friend, who promise not to tell anyone else, but of course they do, and the story soon spreads all over town.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many, including Bernadette's Aunt Bernarde (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Yurka" title="Blanche Yurka">Blanche Yurka</a>), are convinced of her sincerity and stand up for her against her disbelieving parents, but Bernadette faces civil and church authorities alone. Repeatedly questioned, she stands solidly behind her outlandish story and continues to return to the cave as the lady has asked. She faces ridicule as the lady tells her to drink and wash at a spring that doesn't exist, but digs a hole in the ground and uses the wet sand and mud. The water begins to flow later and exhibits miraculous healing properties. The lady finally identifies herself as "the Immaculate Conception". Civil authorities try to have Bernadette declared insane, while AbbÃ© Peyramale, the fatherly cleric who once doubted her and now becomes her staunchest ally, asks for a formal investigation to find out if Bernadette is a fraud, insane, or genuine. The grotto is closed and the Bishop of Tarbes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Waldron" title="Charles Waldron">Charles Waldron</a>) declares that unless the Emperor orders the grotto to openedm there will be no investigation by the church. Shortly thereafter, the Emperor's infant son falls ill and, under instructions from the Empress (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Morison" title="Patricia Morison">Patricia Morison</a>), the child's nanny obtains a bottle of the water. Arrested for violating the closure order, she appears in court, identifies herself as the Empress' employee, and pays the fines of the other persons who attempted to enter the grotto, so that they will not have to serve time in jail. The magistrate permits her to go and to take the bottle of water with her. The Emperor's son drinks the water and recovers. The Empress believes that his recovery is miraculous, but the Emperor is not sure. The Empress upbraids him for doubting God, and at her insistence, the Emperor gives the order to reopen the grotto. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_of_Tarbes" title="Bishop of Tarbes">Bishop of Tarbes</a> then directs the commission to convene. The investigation takes many years, and Bernadette is questioned again and again, but the commission eventually determines that Bernadette experienced visions and was visited by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_Mary" title="Virgin Mary">Virgin Mary</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_of_God" title="Mother of God">Mother of God</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The plot follows the novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Werfel" title="Franz Werfel">Franz Werfel</a>, which is not a documentary but a historical novel blending fact and fiction. Bernadette's real-life friend Antoine Nicolau is portrayed as being deeply in love with her, and vowing to remain unmarried when Bernadette enters the convent. No such relationship is documented as existing between them. The government authorities, in particular Imperial Prosecutor Vital Dutour (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Price" title="Vincent Price">Vincent Price</a>) are portrayed as being much more anti-religion than they actually were, and in fact Dutour was himself a devout <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> who simply thought Bernadette was hallucinating. Other portrayals come closer to historical accuracy, particularly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Bohnen" title="Roman Bohnen">Roman Bohnen</a> as Bernadette's overworked parents, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bickford" title="Charles Bickford">Charles Bickford</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Peyramale" title="Dominique Peyramale">Father Peyramale</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Yurka" title="Blanche Yurka">Blanche Yurka</a> as formidable Aunt Bernarde.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bernadette's death in particular is "Hollywoodized". She would not have had enough breath to talk that much. Peyramale was not present at her deathbed, having himself died two years before. What is uncertain is whether or not she had a vision before she died. Witnesses said that some hours prior to her death, they saw Bernadette looking across the room with great concentration as she did when experiencing a vision, but she didn't say anything. Her last words were a phrase from the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary" title="Hail Mary">Hail Mary</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jennifer Jones had made two minor films earlier, under her real name of Phylis Isley. Zanuck had her credited as "introducing Jennifer Jones as Bernadette" in order to make the public think she was an unknown.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of the production staff believed The Lady should not be visible to the audience but that Bernadette's adoration of something she saw plainly should "render the invisible visible to others", as Werfel's book said the real Bernadette did. The choice of Darnell (then a few months pregnant) with her reputation as a so-called soft-porn model angered Werfel, who threatened to take his name off the picture. Zanuck was determined to use her, so he told Werfel that he had picked an unknown for the role of the Virgin Mary. He draped Darnell in heavier garments and veiling than the historical Bernadette reported for her lady, and filmed her in brilliant light. Darnell is recognizable in the final scene where she comes into Bernadette's room. The lady's few lines are also spoken by Darnell.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It may be difficult for modern viewers to understand the fuss made about Darnell's casting. The 'soft porn' items in question were not films, but a series of photographs, in some of which Darnell is topless. Werfel apparently saw the pictures and demanded that she be removed from production. At the time, mildly erotic or risquÃ© photos or films were called 'blue', and this expression was used to describe the photographs in Selznick's biography <i>Showman</i> (Abacus, 1993). Darnell often portrayed sexy or sultry characters in films, most notably dance hall girl Chihuahua in the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a> Western, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Darling_Clementine_(movie)" title="My Darling Clementine (movie)">My Darling Clementine</a></i>, but also played faithful wives, such as the wives in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_and_Sand_(1941_film)" title="Blood and Sand (1941 film)">Blood and Sand</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfaithfully_Yours" title="Unfaithfully Yours">Unfaithfully Yours</a></i>, as well as virginal sweethearts in such films as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mark_of_Zorro_(1940_film)" title="The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)">The Mark of Zorro</a></i>. She is not known to have made any 'blue' films. Ironically, in later years she became well-known for doing charitable work.</p>
