	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Stanley Kubrick</b> (July 26, 1928Â â€“ March 7, 1999) was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People_of_the_United_States" title="People of the United States">American</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">film director</a>, writer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer" title="Film producer">producer</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographer" title="Photographer">photographer</a> who lived in England during most of the last four decades of his career. Kubrick was noted for the scrupulous care with which he chose his subjects, his slow method of working, the variety of genres he worked in, his technical perfectionism, and his reclusiveness about his films and personal life. He worked far beyond the confines of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> system, maintaining almost complete artistic control and making movies according to his own whims and time constraints, but with the rare advantage of big-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_studio" title="Movie studio">studio</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_support" title="Financial support">financial support</a> for all his endeavors. Although he was nominated for an Academy Award as a screenwriter and director on several occasions, his only personal win was for the special effects in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished, innovative, and influential filmmakers in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_cinema" title="History of cinema">history of cinema</a>. He directed a number of highly acclaimed and often controversial films that have often been perceived as a reflection of his obsessive and perfectionist nature. His films are characterized by a formal visual style and meticulous attention to detailâ€”his later films often have elements of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism" title="Surrealism">surrealism</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism" title="Expressionism">expressionism</a> that eschews structured linear narrative. While often viewed as expressing an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony" title="Irony">ironic</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pessimism" title="Pessimism">pessimism</a>, a few critics feel his films contain a cautious optimism when viewed more carefully. Even though all of his films, apart from the first two, were adapted from novels or short stories, his works are noted as some of the "most original, provocative, and visionary motion pictures ever made".</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stanley Kubrick was born on July 26, 1928 at the Lying-In Hospital in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, the first of two children born to Jacques Leonard Kubrick (1901â€“85) and his wife Gertrude (<i>nÃ©e</i> Perveler; 1903â€“85). His sister, Barbara, was born in 1934. Jacques Kubrick, whose parents and paternal grandparents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austrian</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romanian</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Polish</a> origin, was a doctor. At Stanley's birth, the Kubricks lived in an apartment at 2160 Clinton Avenue in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">The Bronx</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's father taught him <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> at age twelve, and the game remained a lifelong obsession. He also bought his son a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graflex" title="Graflex">Graflex</a> camera when he was thirteen, triggering a fascination with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography" title="Photography">still photography</a>. As a teenager, Kubrick was interested in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and briefly attempted a career as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drummer" title="Drummer">drummer</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Howard_Taft_High_School_(New_York_City)" title="William Howard Taft High School (New York City)">William Howard Taft High School</a> from 1941â€“45. He was a poor student, with a meager 67 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_Point_Average" title="Grade Point Average">grade average</a>. He graduated from high school in 1945, but his poor grades, combined with the demand for college admissions from soldiers returning from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>, eliminated any hopes of higher education. Later in life, Kubrick spoke disdainfully of his education and of education in general, maintaining that nothing about school interested him. His parents sent him to live with relatives for a year in Los Angeles in the hopes that it would help his academic growth.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While still in high school, he was chosen as an official school photographer for a year. In 1946, since he wasn't able to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> (CCNY) and then left. Eventually, he sought jobs as a freelance photographer, and by graduation, he had sold a photographic series to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_(American_magazine)" title="Look (American magazine)">Look</a></i> magazine. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess "for quarters" in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Square_Park" title="Washington Square Park">Washington Square Park</a> and various <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> chess clubs. He became an apprentice photographer for <i>Look</i> in 1946, and later a full-time staff photographer. (Many early [1945â€“50] photographs by Kubrick have been published in the book <i>Drama and Shadows</i> [2005, Phaidon Press] and also appear as a special feature on the 2007 Special Edition DVD of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>.)</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his <i>Look</i> magazine years, Kubrick married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Toba_Metz&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Toba Metz (page does not exist)">Toba Metz</a> (b. 1930) on May 29, 1948. They lived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a>, eventually divorcing in 1951. During this time, Kubrick began frequenting film screenings at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> and the cinemas of New York City. He was particularly inspired by the complex, fluid camerawork of director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Oph%C3%BCls" title="Max OphÃ¼ls">Max OphÃ¼ls</a>, whose films influenced Kubrick's later visual style.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Film_career_and_later_life">Film career and later life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1951, Kubrick's friend Alex Singer persuaded him to start making short documentaries for <i>The March of Time</i>, a provider of newsreels to movie theatres. Kubrick agreed, and shot the independently financed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Fight" title="Day of the Fight">Day of the Fight</a></i> in 1951. The film notably employed a reverse <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_shot" title="Tracking shot">tracking shot</a>, which would become one of Kubrick's signature camera movements. Although its distributor went out of business that year, Kubrick has been said to have sold <i>Day of the Fight</i> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> for a profit of $100, although Kubrick himself said he lost $100 in <i>Jeremy Bernstein, Interview With Stanley Kubrick</i> in 1966. Inspired by this early success, Kubrick quit his job at <i>Look</i> magazine and began working on his second short documentary, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Padre" title="Flying Padre">Flying Padre</a></i> (1951), funded by RKO. A third short film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seafarers" title="The Seafarers">The Seafarers</a></i> (1953) was filmed just after his first feature <i>Fear and Desire</i> (see below) in order to recoup costs. It was a 30-minute promotional film for the Seafarers' International Union and was Kubrick's first color film. These three films constitute Kubrick's only surviving work in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary</a> genre. It is believed, however, that he was involved in other shorts, which have been lostâ€”most notably <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Assembly_of_Youth_(film)" title="World Assembly of Youth (film)">World Assembly of Youth</a></i> (1952). He also served as second unit director on an episode of the <i>Omnibus</i> television program about the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. None of these shorts has ever been officially released, though they have been widely bootlegged, and clips are used in the documentary <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures</i>. In addition, <i>Day of the Fight</i> and <i>Flying Padre</i> have been shown on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Classic_Movies" title="Turner Classic Movies">TCM</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick moved to narrative feature films with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Desire" title="Fear and Desire">Fear and Desire</a></i> (1953), the story of a team of soldiers caught behind enemy lines in a fictional war. While wracked with anxiety about how they will escape, they stumble across a woman whom they capture for fear of her reporting them. One of the soldiers begins to fall in love with her, but shoots her when she tries to escape. He then abandons the troop. Another soldier becomes unsatisfied with a simple escape down the river and persuades the remaining soldiers to engage in a scheme to kill a general in a surprise attack at a nearby base.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick and his then-wife, Toba Metz, were the only crew on the film, which was written by Kubrick's friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Sackler" title="Howard Sackler">Howard Sackler</a>, who later became a successful playwright. <i>Fear and Desire</i> garnered respectable reviews but was a commercial failure. Later in life, Kubrick was embarrassed by the film, which he dismissed as an amateur effort. He refused to allow <i>Fear and Desire</i> to be shown at retrospectives and public screenings and did everything possible to keep it out of circulation. At least one copy remained in the archives of the film printing company, and the film subsequently surfaced in bootleg copies.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's marriage to Toba Metz ended during the making of <i>Fear and Desire</i>. He met his second wife, Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Sobotka" title="Ruth Sobotka">Ruth Sobotka</a>, in 1952. They lived together in New York's East Village from 1952 until their marriage on January 15, 1955. They moved to Hollywood that summer. Sobotka, who made a cameo appearance in Kubrick's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer%27s_Kiss" title="Killer's Kiss">Killer's Kiss</a></i> (1955), also served as art director on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(film)" title="The Killing (film)">The Killing</a></i> (1956). Like <i>Fear and Desire,</i> <i>Killer's Kiss</i> is a short feature film, with a running time of slightly more than an hour. It met with limited commercial and critical success. The film is about a young heavyweight boxer at the end of his career who gets involved in a love triangle in which his rival is involved with organized crime. Both <i>Fear and Desire</i> and <i>Killer's Kiss</i> were privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alex Singer introduced Kubrick to a young producer named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_B._Harris" title="James B. Harris">James B. Harris</a>, and the two became close friends. Their business partnership, Harris-Kubrick Productions, would finance Kubrick's next three films. The two bought the rights to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_White" title="Lionel White">Lionel White</a> novel <i>Clean Break</i>, which Kubrick and co-screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thompson_(writer)" title="Jim Thompson (writer)">Jim Thompson</a> turned into <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(film)" title="The Killing (film)">The Killing</a></i>. The story is about a meticulously planned racetrack robbery gone wrong after the mobsters get away with the money. (The film title may refer either to the robbery or the subsequent murder of a group of mobsters by a jealous boyfriend). Starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden" title="Sterling Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_(film)" title="The Killing (film)">The Killing</a></i> was Kubrick's first full-length feature film shot with a professional cast and crew. As does the novel's narration, the story in the film is told out of sequence in a non-linear narrative as a consequence of retelling the events of the same day (and sometimes the same events) from the perspective of different characters. (This is not the same as using successive multiple in-world flashbacks as <i>Citizen Kane</i> does.) While this technique was highly unusual for contemporary 1950s American cinema, it was imitated nearly 40 years later in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_Dogs" title="Reservoir Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a></i> by director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quentin_Tarantino" title="Quentin Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> who has acknowledged Kubrick's film as a major influence, and critics have noticed the similarity in plot structure. In many ways, <i>The Killing</i> followed the conventions of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a>, both in its plotting and cinematography style. That kind of crime caper film had peaked in the 1940s; but today, many regard this film as one of the best of the noir genre. While it was not a financial success, it received good reviews.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The widespread admiration for <i>The Killing</i> brought Harris-Kubrick Productions to the attention of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. The studio offered them its massive collection of copyrighted stories from which to choose their next project. During this time, Kubrick also collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Willingham" title="Calder Willingham">Calder Willingham</a> on an adaptation of the Austrian novel <i>The Burning Secret</i>. Although Kubrick was enthusiastic about the project, it was eventually shelved.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paths_of_Glory" title="Paths of Glory">Paths of Glory</a></i> was set during World War I and based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Cobb" title="Humphrey Cobb">Humphrey Cobb</a>'s 1935 antiwar novel of the same name. It follows a French army unit ordered on an impossible mission by their superiors. As a result of the mission's failure, three innocent soldiers are charged with cowardice and sentenced to death, allegedly as an example to the troops, but actually serving as scapegoats for the failings of their commanders. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a> was cast as Colonel Dax, a humanitarian officer who tries to prevent the soldiers' execution. Douglas was instrumental in securing financing for the ambitious production. The film was not a significant commercial success, but it was critically acclaimed and widely admired within the industry, establishing Kubrick as a major up-and-coming young filmmaker. Critics over the years have praised the film's unsentimental, spare, and unvarnished combat scenes and its raw, black-and-white cinematography. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> has named this one of his favorite Kubrick films.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the production of <i>Paths of Glory</i> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a>, Kubrick met and romanced young German actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiane_Harlan" title="Christiane Harlan">Christiane Harlan</a> (credited by her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_name" title="Stage name">stage name</a>, "Susanne Christian"), who played the only female speaking part in the film. Kubrick divorced his second wife, Ruth Sobotka, in 1957. Christiane Susanne Harlan (b. 1932 in Germany) belonged to a theatrical family and had trained as an actress. She and Kubrick married in 1958 and remained together until his death in 1999. During her marriage to Kubrick, Christiane concentrated on her career as a painter. In addition to raising Christiane's young daughter Katharina (b. 1953) from her first marriage to the late German actor Werner Bruhns (d. 1977), the couple had two daughters, Anya (1959â€“2009) and Vivian (b. 1960). Christiane's brother <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harlan" title="Jan Harlan">Jan Harlan</a> was Kubrick's executive producer from 1975 onward.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon his return to the United States, Kubrick worked for six months on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a> vehicle <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Eyed_Jacks" title="One-Eyed Jacks">One-Eyed Jacks</a></i> (1961). The two clashed over a number of casting decisions, and Brando eventually fired him and decided to direct the picture himself. Kubrick worked on a number of unproduced screenplays, including <i>Lunatic at Large</i>, which Kubrick intended to develop into a movie, until <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a> asked him to take over Douglas' epic production <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film)" title="Spartacus (film)">Spartacus</a></i> (1960) from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Mann" title="Anthony Mann">Anthony Mann</a>, who had been fired by the studio two weeks into shooting.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based upon the true story of a doomed uprising of Roman slaves, <i>Spartacus</i> was a difficult production. Creative differences arose between Kubrick and Douglas, and the two reportedly had a stormy working relationship. Frustrated by his lack of creative control, Kubrick later largely disowned the film, which further angered Douglas. The friendship the two men had formed on <i>Paths of Glory</i> was destroyed by the experience of making the film. Years later, Douglas referred to Kubrick as "a talented shit."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the on-set troubles, <i>Spartacus</i> was a critical and commercial success and established Kubrick as a major director. However, its embattled production convinced Kubrick to find ways of working with Hollywood financing while remaining independent of its production system, which he called "film by fiat, film by frenzy."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Spartacus</i> is the only Stanley Kubrick film in which Kubrick had no hand in the screenplay, no final cut, no producing credit, or any say in the casting.  It was largely Kirk Douglas' project.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Spartacus</i> would go on to win 4 Oscars with one going to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>, for his turn as the slave dealer Batiatus, the only actor to win one under Kubrick's direction.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1962, Kubrick moved to England to film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_(1962_film)" title="Lolita (1962 film)">Lolita</a></i>, and he would live there for the rest of his life. The original motivation was to film <i>Lolita</i> in a country with laxer censorship laws. However, Kubrick had to remain in England to film <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> since Peter Sellers was not permitted to leave England at the time as he was involved in divorce proceedings, and the filming of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> required the large capacity of the sound stages of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepperton_Studios" title="Shepperton Studios">Shepperton Studios</a>, which were not available in America. It was after filming the first two of these films in England and in the early planning stages of <i>2001</i> that Kubrick decided to settle in England permanently.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Lolita</i> was Kubrick's first film to generate major controversy. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita" title="Lolita">book</a>, by Russian-American novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Nabokov" title="Vladimir Nabokov">Vladimir Nabokov</a>, dealt with an affair between a middle-aged man named Humbert Humbert (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>) and his twelve-year-old stepdaughter, and was already notorious as an "obscene" novel and a <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cause_c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre" title="wiktionary:cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre">cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre</a></i> when Kubrick embarked on the project. The difficult subject matter was mocked in the film's famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagline" title="Tagline">tagline</a>, "How did they ever make a film of <i>Lolita</i>?" Kubrick originally engaged Nabokov to adapt his own novel for the screen. The writer first produced a 400-page screenplay, which he then reduced to 200. The final screenplay was written by Kubrick himself, and Nabokov himself estimated that only 20% of his work made it into the film. Nabokov's original draft was later published under the title <i>Lolita: A Screenplay</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to its release, Kubrick realized that to get a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_Code" title="Production Code">Production Code</a> seal, the screenplay would have to downplay the book's provocativeness, treading lightly with its theme. Kubrick tried to make some elements more acceptable by omitting all material referring to Humbert's lifelong infatuation with "nymphets" and possibly ensuring Lolita looked like a teenager. James Harris, Kubrick's co-producer and uncredited co-screenwriter of <i>Lolita</i> decided with Kubrick to raise Lolita's age. Nonetheless, Kubrick had liaised with the censors during production and it was only "slightly edited", in particular removing the eroticism between Lolita and Humbert. As a result, the novel's more sensual aspects were toned down in the final cut, leaving much to the viewer's imagination. Kubrick would later say that had he known the severity of the censorship he would face, he probably would not have made the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Lolita</i> was the first of two times Kubrick worked with British comic actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>, the second being <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> (1964). Sellers plays Clare Quilty, a second older man (unknown to Humbert) who is involved with Lolita, serving dramatically as Humbert's darker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelganger" title="Doppelganger">doppelganger</a>. In the novel, Quilty is behind the scenes for most of the story, but Kubrick brings him to the foreground, which resulted in an expansion of his role (although it is only about thirty minutes of screen time). Kubrick exercises his dramatic license, and has Quilty pretend to be multiple characters in the film, allowing Sellers to employ his gift for mock accents.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical reception of the film was mixed; many praised it for its daring subject matter, while others were surprised by the lack of intimacy between Lolita and Humbert. The film received an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Adapted_Screenplay" title="Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Lyon" title="Sue Lyon">Sue Lyon</a>, who played the title role, won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> for Best Newcomer.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Youngblood" title="Gene Youngblood">Gene Youngblood</a> holds that stylistically <i>Lolita</i> is a transitional film for Kubrick, "marking the turning point from a naturalistic cinema...to the surrealism of the later films."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a></i> (1964), became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult film</a> and is now considered a classic. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that it is the best <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satirical_film" title="Satirical film">satirical film</a> ever made. The screenplayâ€”based upon the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Alert_(novel)" title="Red Alert (novel)">Red Alert</a></i>, by ex-RAF flight lieutenant <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_George_(author)" title="Peter George (author)">Peter George</a> (writing as Peter Bryant)â€”was co-written by Kubrick and George, with contributions by American satirist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Southern" title="Terry Southern">Terry Southern</a>. <i>Red Alert</i> is a serious, cautionary tale of accidental atomic war. However, Kubrick found the conditions leading to nuclear war so absurd that the story became a sinister macabre comedy. Once re-conceived, Kubrick recruited Terry Southern to polish the final screenplay.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story centers on an unauthorized American nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, initiated by renegade U.S.A.F. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden" title="Sterling Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a>; the character's name is a reference to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>). When Ripper gives his orders, the bombers are all at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-safe" title="Fail-safe">fail-safe</a> points, before which passing they cannot arm their warheads, and past which, they cannot proceed without direct orders. Once past this point, the planes will only return with a prearranged recall code. The film intercuts between three locales: Ripper's Air Force Base, where RAF Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Sellers) tries to stop the mad Gen. Ripper by obtaining the codes; the Pentagon War Room, where the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> (Sellers) and U.S.A.F. Gen. Buck Turgidson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C. Scott">George C. Scott</a>) try to develop a strategy with the Soviets to stop Gen. Ripper's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-52_bomber" title="B-52 bomber">B-52</a> bombers from dropping nuclear bombs on Russia; and Major Kong's (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Pickens" title="Slim Pickens">Slim Pickens</a>) B-52 bomber, where he and his crew of airmen (never knowing their orders are false) doggedly try to complete their mission. It soon becomes clear that the bombers may reach Russia, since only Gen. Ripper knows the recall codes. At this point, the character of Dr. Strangelove (Sellers' third role) is introduced. His Nazi-style plans for ensuring the survival of the fittest of the human race in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust are the black-comedy highlight of the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>, who had played a pivotal part in <i>Lolita</i>, was hired to play four roles in <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>. He eventually played three, due to an injured leg and his difficulty in mastering bomber pilot Major "King" Kong's Texas accent. Kubrick later called Sellers "amazing", but lamented the fact that the actor's manic energy rarely lasted beyond two or three takes. To overcome this problem, Kubrick ran two cameras simultaneously and let Sellers improvise.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film prefigured the antiwar sentiments which would become explosive only a few years after its release. It was highly irreverent toward war policies of the U.S., which were largely considered sacrosanct up to that time. Eight months after the release of <i>Strangelove</i>, the straight thriller <i>Fail-Safe</i> with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove#Fail-Safe" title="Dr. Strangelove">plot remarkably similar to</a> that of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> was released. <i>Strangelove</i> earned four Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture and Best Director) and the New York Film Critics' Best Director award.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick spent five years developing his next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i> (1968). The film was conceived as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinerama" title="Cinerama">Cinerama</a> spectacle and was photographed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Panavision_70" title="Super Panavision 70">Super Panavision 70</a>. Kubrick co-wrote the screenplay with science fiction writer Sir <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_C._Clarke" title="Arthur C. Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, expanding on Clarke's short story "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(short_story)" title="The Sentinel (short story)">The Sentinel</a>". Kubrick reportedly told Clarke that his intention was to make "the proverbial great science fiction film."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>2001</i> begins four million years ago with an encounter between a group of apes and a mysterious black monolith, which seems to trigger in them the ability to use a bone as both a tool and a weapon. This new knowledge allows them to reclaim a water hole from another group of apes, who have no <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_use_by_animals" title="Tool use by animals">tool-wielding ability</a>. A victorious ape tosses his bone into the air, at which point the film makes a celebrated match-cut to an orbiting satellite, circa 2000. At this time, a group of Americans at their moon base dig up a monolith similar to that encountered by the apes, which sends a radio signal to Jupiter. Eighteen months later, a group of astronauts aboard the spaceship Discovery are sent to explore Jupiter, their true purpose of investigating the signal is initially concealed from them. During the flight, the ship's sentient <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000" title="HAL 9000">HAL 9000</a> computer, aware of the truth about the mission, malfunctions but resists disconnection. Believing its control of the mission to be crucial, the computer terminates life support for most of the crew before it is shut down by the surviving astronaut, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Bowman_(Space_Odyssey)" title="David Bowman (Space Odyssey)">David Bowman</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Dullea" title="Keir Dullea">Keir Dullea</a>). Using a space pod, Bowman explores another monolith in orbit around Jupiter, whereupon he is hurled into a portal in space at high speed, witnessing many strange cosmological phenomena. His interstellar journey ends with his transformation into a fetus-like new being enclosed in an orb of light, last seen gazing at Earth from space.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The $10,000,000 (U.S.) film was a massive production for its time. The groundbreaking visual effects were overseen by Kubrick and were engineered by a team that included a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Trumbull" title="Douglas Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a>, who would become famous in his own right for his work on the films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Running" title="Silent Running">Silent Running</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner" title="Blade Runner">Blade Runner</a></i>. Kubrick extensively used traveling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matte" title="Matte">matte</a> photography to film space flight, a technique also used nine years later by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> in making <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars</a></i>, although that film also used motion-control effects that were unavailable to Kubrick at the time. Kubrick made innovative use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slit-scan_photography" title="Slit-scan photography">slit-scan photography</a> to film the Stargate sequence. The film's striking cinematography was the work of legendary British director of photography <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Unsworth" title="Geoffrey Unsworth">Geoffrey Unsworth</a>, who would later photograph classic films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabaret_(film)" title="Cabaret (film)">Cabaret</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>. Manufacturing companies were consulted as to what the design of both special-purpose and everyday objects would look like in the future. At the time of the movie's release, Arthur C. Clarke predicted that a generation of engineers would design real spacecraft based upon <i>2001</i> "â€¦even if it isn't the best way to do it." The film also is a rare instance of portraying space travel realistically, with complete silence in the vacuum of space and a realistic representation of weightlessness.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is famous for using classical music in place of an original score. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Strauss" title="Richard Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Also_sprach_Zarathustra_(Richard_Strauss)" title="Also sprach Zarathustra (Richard Strauss)">Also sprach Zarathustra</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Strauss_II" title="Johann Strauss II">Johann Strauss's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Danube" title="The Blue Danube">The Blue Danube</a></i> waltz became indelibly associated with the film for a while, especially the former, as it was not well-known to the public prior to the film. Kubrick also used music by contemporary avant-garde Hungarian composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Ligeti" title="GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti">GyÃ¶rgy Ligeti</a>, although some of the pieces were altered without Ligeti's consent. The appearance of <i>Atmospheres</i>, <i>Lux Aeterna</i>, and <i>Requiem</i> on the <i>2001</i> soundtrack was the first wide commercial exposure of Ligeti's work. This use of "program" music was not originally planned. Kubrick had commissioned composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_North" title="Alex North">Alex North</a> to write a full-length score for the film, but Kubrick became so attached to the temporary soundtrack he had constructed during editing that he dropped the idea of an original score entirely.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although it eventually became an enormous success, the film was not an immediate hit. Initial critical reaction was extremely hostile, with critics attacking the film's lack of dialogue, slow pacing, and seemingly impenetrable storyline. One of the film's few defenders was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penelope_Gilliatt" title="Penelope Gilliatt">Penelope Gilliatt</a>, who called it (in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>) "some kind of a great film". Word of mouth among young audiencesâ€”especially the 1960s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture" title="Counterculture">counterculture</a> audience, who loved the movie's "Star Gate" sequence, a seemingly psychedelic journey to the infinite reaches of the cosmosâ€”made the film a hit. Despite nominations in the directing, writing, and producing categories, the only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Visual_Effects" title="Academy Award for Visual Effects">Academy Award</a> Kubrick ever received was for supervising the special effects of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. Today, however, many consider it the greatest <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-fi_film" title="Sci-fi film">sci-fi film</a> ever made, and it is a staple on All Time Top 10 lists.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Artistically, <i>2001</i> was a radical departure from Kubrick's previous films. It contains only 45 minutes of spoken dialogue, over a running time of two hours and twenty minutes. The fairly mundane dialogue is mostly superfluous to the images and music. The film's most memorable dialogue belongs to the computer HAL in HAL's exchanges with Dave Bowman. Some argue that Kubrick is portraying a future humanity largely dissociated from a sterile and antiseptic machine-driven environment. The film's ambiguous, perplexing ending continues to fascinate contemporary audiences and critics. After this film, Kubrick would never experiment so radically with special effects or narrative form; however, his subsequent films would still maintain some level of ambiguity.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interpretations of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> are numerous and diverse. Despite having been released in 1968, it still prompts debate today. When critic Joseph Gelmis asked Kubrick about the meaning of the film, Kubrick replied:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> is perhaps Kubrick's most famous and influential film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> called it his generation's big bang, focusing attention upon the space race. It was a precursor to the explosion of the science fiction film market nine years later, which began with the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>2001</i>, Kubrick initially attempted to make a film about the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. When financing fell through, Kubrick went looking for a project that he could film quickly on a small budget. He eventually settled on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)" title="A Clockwork Orange (film)">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> (1971). His adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Burgess" title="Anthony Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>' novel is a dark, shocking exploration of violence in human society. The film was initially released with an X <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_rating_systems" title="Motion picture rating systems">rating</a> in the United States  and caused considerable controversy. The film's iconic poster imagery was created by legendary designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gold" title="Bill Gold">Bill Gold</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story takes place in a futuristic version of Great Britain that is both authoritarian and chaotic. The central character is a teenage <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooligan" title="Hooligan">hooligan</a> named Alex DeLarge (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell" title="Malcolm McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>), who, along with his companion "droogs", gleefully torments, beats, robs, tortures, and rapes without conscience or remorse. His brutal beating and murder of an older woman finally lands Alex in prison. Alex undergoes an experimental medical aversion treatment, known as the Ludovico Technique, that inhibits his violent tendencies, though he has no real free moral choice. At the public demonstration of the success of the technique, Alex is treated cruelly but does not fight back; the treatment has made him less than human. He has been conditioned against classical music, his love of which was his one human feature, and apparently all of his sex drive is gone. We further see hints that the promotion of the treatment is politically motivated. After being freed, he is found by his former partners in crime who had betrayed him and who are now policemen, and they beat him mercilessly.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The society was sometimes perceived as Communist (as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Ciment" title="Michel Ciment">Michel Ciment</a> pointed out in an interview with Kubrick, although he himself didn't feel that way) due to its slight ties to Russian culture. The teenage slang has a heavily Russian vocabulary, which can be attributed to Burgess. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one, or perhaps a society moving out of a failed, Leftist socialism and into a Rightist, or fascist, society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and in the film, there is a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)" title="Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party</a> architecture, and the name "Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North" alludes to socialist-style housing. Later in the film, when the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to exactly what kind of society it is. He held that the film held comparisons between both the left and right end of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated, "The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left. ...They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick photographed <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> quickly and almost entirely on location in and around London. Despite the low-tech nature of the film as compared to <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, Kubrick showed his talent for innovation; at one point, he threw "an old Newman Sinclair clockwork mechanism camera" off a rooftop in order to achieve the effect he wanted. For the score, Kubrick enlisted electronic music composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Carlos" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>â€”at the time, known as Walter Carlos (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switched-On_Bach" title="Switched-On Bach">Switched-On Bach</a></i>)â€”to adapt famous classical works (such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven" title="Ludwig van Beethoven">Beethoven's</a> Ninth Symphony) for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moog_synthesizer" title="Moog synthesizer">Moog synthesizer</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is pivotal to the plot that the lead character, Alex, is fond of classical music, and that the brainwashing Ludovico treatment accidentally conditions him against classical music. As such, it was natural for Kubrick to continue the tradition begun in <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> of using a great deal of classical music in the score. However, in this film, classical music accompanies scenes of violent mayhem and coercive sexuality rather than of graceful space flight and mysterious alien presences. Both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> (who generally disliked Kubrick) and Roger Ebert (who often praises Kubrick) found Kubrick's use of juxtaposing classical music and violence in this film unpleasant, Ebert calling it a "cute, cheap, dead-end dimension," and Kael, "self-important." Burgess, in his introduction to his own stage adaptation of the novel, held that ultimately, classical music is what will finally redeem Alex.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was extremely controversial because of its explicit depiction of teenage gang rape and violence. It was released in the same year as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah" title="Sam Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_Dogs" title="Straw Dogs">Straw Dogs</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegel" title="Don Siegel">Don Siegel</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry" title="Dirty Harry">Dirty Harry</a></i>, and the three films sparked a ferocious debate in the media about the social effects of cinematic violence. The controversy was exacerbated when copycat crimes were committed in England by criminals wearing the same costumes as characters in <i>A Clockwork Orange.</i> British readers of the novel noted that Kubrick had omitted the final chapter (also omitted from American editions of the book) in which Alex finds redemption and sanity.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After receiving death threats to himself and his family as a result of the controversy, Kubrick took the unusual step of removing the film from circulation in Britain. It was unavailable in the United Kingdom until its re-release in 2000, a year after Kubrick's death, although it could be seen in continental Europe. The Scala cinema in London's Kings Cross showed the film in the early 1990s, and at Kubrick's insistence, the cinema was sued and put out of business, thus depriving London of one of its very few independent cinemas. It is now the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(club)" title="Scala (club)">Scala</a> club. In early 1973, Kubrick re-released <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange" title="A Clockwork Orange">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> to cinemas in the United States with footage modified so that it could get its rating reduced to an R. This enabled many more newspapers to advertise it, since in 1972 many newspapers had stopped carrying any advertising for X-rated films due to the new association of that rating with pornography.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid-1990s, a documentary entitled <i>Forbidden Fruit</i>, about the censorship controversy, was released in Britain. Kubrick was unable to prevent the documentary makers from including footage from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> in their film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's next film, released in 1975, was an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Makepeace_Thackeray" title="William Makepeace Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Luck_of_Barry_Lyndon" title="The Luck of Barry Lyndon">The Luck of Barry Lyndon</a></i>, also known as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Lyndon" title="Barry Lyndon">Barry Lyndon</a>,</i> a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque_novel" title="Picaresque novel">picaresque novel</a> about the adventures and misadventures of an 18th-century Irish gambler and social climber. After serving in the Prussian army, Lyndon slowly insinuates himself into English high society, eventually marrying the Countess of Lyndon. The world of the aristocracy turns out to be a hollow paradise, dull and decaying. Lyndon is ultimately unable to maintain his good standing there and falls from grace after a series of persecutions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reviewers such as Pauline Kael, who had been critical of Kubrick's previous work, found <i>Barry Lyndon</i> a cold, slow-moving, and lifeless film. Its measured pace and lengthâ€”more than three hoursâ€”put off many American critics and audiences, although it received positive reviews from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Reed" title="Rex Reed">Rex Reed</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel" title="Richard Schickel">Richard Schickel</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine published a cover story about the film, and Kubrick was nominated for three Academy Awards. The film as a whole was nominated for seven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> and won four, more than any other Kubrick film. Despite this, <i>Barry Lyndon</i> was not a box office success in the U.S., although the film found a great audience in Europe, particularly in France. The French journal of film criticism, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_du_cin%C3%A9ma" title="Cahiers du cinÃ©ma">Cahiers du cinÃ©ma</a></i>, included <i>Barry Lyndon</i> at 67 on its top 100 list of all-time films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As with most of Kubrick's films, <i>Barry Lyndon'</i>s reputation has grown through the years, particularly among other filmmakers. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a> has cited it as his favorite Kubrick film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> has praised its "impeccable technique", though, when younger, he famously described it "like going through the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museo_del_Prado" title="Museo del Prado">Prado</a> without lunch."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As in his other films, Kubrick's cinematography and lighting techniques were highly innovative. Most famously, interior scenes were shot with a specially adapted high-speed f/0.7 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG" title="Carl Zeiss AG">Zeiss</a> camera lens originally developed for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a>. This allowed many scenes to be lit only with candlelight, creating two-dimensional diffused-light images reminiscent of 18th-century paintings.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Like its two predecessors, the film does not have an original score. Irish traditional songs (performed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chieftains" title="The Chieftains">The Chieftains</a>) are combined with works such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Vivaldi" title="Antonio Vivaldi">Antonio Vivaldi</a>'s Cello Concerto in B, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach" title="Johann Sebastian Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> Double Concerto, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Frideric_Handel" title="George Frideric Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarabande" title="Sarabande">Sarabande</a></i> from the Keyboard Suite in D minor (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis" title="HÃ¤ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis">HWV</a> 448, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A4ndel-Gesellschaft" title="HÃ¤ndel-Gesellschaft">HG</a> II/ii/4), and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Schubert" title="Franz Schubert">Franz Schubert</a>'s German Dance No. 1 in CÂ major, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piano_Trio_No._2_(Schubert)" title="Piano Trio No. 2 (Schubert)">Piano Trio No. 2 in E flat</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impromptus_(Schubert)#Four_Impromptus.2C_Op._90_.28D._899.29" title="Impromptus (Schubert)">Impromptu No. 1 in C minor</a>. The music was conducted and adapted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Rosenman" title="Leonard Rosenman">Leonard Rosenman</a>, for which he won an Oscar.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1976, production designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Adam" title="Ken Adam">Ken Adam</a>, who had worked with Kubrick on <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, asked Kubrick to visit the recently completed 007 Stage at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinewood_Studios" title="Pinewood Studios">Pinewood Studios</a> to provide advice on how to light the enormous soundstage, which had been built and prepared for the James Bond movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spy_Who_Loved_Me_(film)" title="The Spy Who Loved Me (film)">The Spy Who Loved Me</a></i>. Kubrick agreed to consult when it was promised that nobody would ever know of his involvement. This was honored until after his death in 1999, when in 2000 the fact was revealed by Adam in the documentary on the making of <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i> on the special edition DVD release of the movie.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The pace of Kubrick's work slowed considerably after <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, and he did not make another film for five years. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)" title="The Shining (film)">The Shining</a></i>, released in 1980, was adapted from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(novel)" title="The Shining (novel)">novel</a> of the same name by bestselling horror writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>. The film starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> as Jack Torrance, a failed writer who takes a job as an off-season caretaker of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlook_Hotel" title="Overlook Hotel">Overlook Hotel</a>, a high-class resort deep in the Colorado mountains. The job requires spending the winter in the isolated hotel with his wife, Wendy (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Duvall" title="Shelley Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a>) and their young son, Danny, who is gifted with a form of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a>â€”the "shining" of the film's title.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As winter takes hold, the family's isolation deepens, and the demons and ghosts of the Overlook Hotel's dark past begin to awake, displaying horrible, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria" title="Phantasmagoria">phantasmagoric</a> images to Danny, and driving his father Jack into a homicidal <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">psychosis</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was shot entirely on London soundstages, with the exception of second-unit exterior footage, which was filmed in Colorado, Montana, and Oregon. In order to convey the claustrophobic oppression of the haunted hotel, Kubrick made extensive use of the newly invented <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steadicam" title="Steadicam">Steadicam</a>, a weight-balanced camera support, which allowed for smooth camera movement in enclosed spaces.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More than any of his other films, <i>The Shining</i> gave rise to the legend of Kubrick as a megalomaniac <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectionist" title="Perfectionist">perfectionist</a>. Reportedly, he demanded hundreds of takes of certain scenes (approximately 1.3 million feet of film was shot). This process was particularly difficult for actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Duvall" title="Shelley Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a>, who was used to the faster, improvisational style of director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Altman" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stephen King disliked the movie, calling Kubrick "a man who thinks too much and feels too little." In 1997, King collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Garris" title="Mick Garris">Mick Garris</a> to create a television miniseries version of the novel that was more faithful to King's original.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opened to mixed reviews, but proved a commercial success. As with most Kubrick films, subsequent critical reaction has treated the film more favorably. Among horror movie fans, <i>The Shining</i> is a cult classic, often appearing at the top of best horror film lists alongside <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i> (1960), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)" title="The Exorcist (film)">The Exorcist</a></i> (1973), and other horror classics. Much of its imagery, such as the elevator shaft disgorging blood and the ghost girls in the hallway are among the most recognizable and widely known images from any Stanley Kubrick film, as are the lines "Redrum" and "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy". The financial success of <i>The Shining</i> renewed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>' faith in Kubrick's ability to make artistically satisfying and profitable films after the commercial failure of <i>Barry Lyndon</i> in the United States.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Seven years later, Kubrick made his next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Metal_Jacket" title="Full Metal Jacket">Full Metal Jacket</a></i> (1987), an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Hasford" title="Gustav Hasford">Gustav Hasford</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Short-Timers" title="The Short-Timers">The Short-Timers</a>,</i> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Modine" title="Matthew Modine">Matthew Modine</a> as Joker, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Baldwin" title="Adam Baldwin">Adam Baldwin</a> as Animal Mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey" title="R.

Lee Ermey</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunnery_Sergeant" title="Gunnery Sergeant">Gunnery Sergeant</a> Hartman, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_D%27Onofrio" title="Vincent D'Onofrio">Vincent D'Onofrio</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)" title="Private (rank)">Private</a> Leonard "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomer_Pyle" title="Gomer Pyle">Gomer Pyle</a>" Lawrence. Kubrick said to film critic Steven Hall that his attraction to Gustav Hasford's book was because it was "neither antiwar or prowar", held "no moral or political position", and was primarily concerned with "the way things are."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film begins at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Recruit_Depot_Parris_Island" title="Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island">Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>, U.S., where Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman relentlessly pushes his recruits through basic training in order to transform them from worthless "maggots" into motivated and disciplined killing machines. Private Lawrence, an overweight, slow-witted recruit who Hartman has nicknamed "Gomer Pyle", is unable to cope with the program and slowly cracks under the strain. On the eve of graduation, he has a psychotic breakdown and murders Hartman before killing himself.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In characteristic Kubrick style, the second half of the film jumps abruptly to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam" title="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>, following Joker, since promoted to sergeant. As a reporter for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military" title="United States military">United States military</a>'s newspaper, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_Stripes_(newspaper)" title="Stars and Stripes (newspaper)">Stars and Stripes</a></i>, Joker occupies war's middle ground, using wit and sarcasm to detach himself from the carnage around him. Though a Marine at war, he is also a reporter and is thus compelled to abide by the ethics of his profession. The film then follows an infantry platoon's advance on and through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hu%E1%BA%BF" title="Huáº¿">Hue City</a>, decimated by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive" title="Tet Offensive">Tet Offensive</a>. The film climaxes in a battle between Joker's platoon and a sniper hiding in the rubble, who is revealed to be a young girl. She almost kills Joker until his reporter partner shoots and severely injures her. Joker then kills her to put her out of her misery.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming a Vietnam War film in England was a considerable challenge for Kubrick and his production team. Much of the filming was done in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Docklands" title="London Docklands">Docklands</a> area of London, with the ruined-city set created by production designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Furst" title="Anton Furst">Anton Furst</a>. As a result, the film is visually very different from other Vietnam War films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_(film)" title="Platoon (film)">Platoon</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_Hill" title="Hamburger Hill">Hamburger Hill</a></i>, most of which were shot in the Far East. Instead of a tropical, Southeast-Asian jungle, the second half of the story unfolds in a city, illuminating the urban warfare aspect of a war generally portrayed (and thus perceived) as jungle warfare, notwithstanding significant urban skirmishes like the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_offensive" title="Tet offensive">Tet offensive</a>. Reviewers and commentators thought this contributed to the bleakness and seriousness of the film. During the making of the film, Kubrick was also helped by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey" title="R. Lee Ermey">R. Lee Ermey</a>, who acted and worked as technical adviser.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Full Metal Jacket</i> received mixed critical reviews on release but also found a reasonably large audience, despite being overshadowed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone" title="Oliver Stone">Oliver Stone</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platoon_(film)" title="Platoon (film)">Platoon</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreak_Ridge" title="Heartbreak Ridge">Heartbreak Ridge</a></i>. Like Kubrick's other films, its critical status has increased immensely since its initial release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's final film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Shut" title="Eyes Wide Shut">Eyes Wide Shut</a></i>, starring then-married actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> as a wealthy Manhattan couple on a sexual odyssey.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> is based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Schnitzler" title="Arthur Schnitzler">Arthur Schnitzler</a>'s Freudian novella <i>Traumnovelle</i> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Story" title="Dream Story">Dream Story</a></i> in English), although the story has been moved from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> in the 1920s to New York City in the 1990s. It follows Dr. William Harford's journey into the sexual underworld of New York City, after his wife, Alice, has shattered his faith in her fidelity by confessing to having fantasized about giving him and their daughter up for one night with another man. Until then, Harford had presumed women are more naturally faithful than men. This new revelation generates doubt and despair, and he begins to roam the streets of New York, acting blindly on his jealousy.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was in production for more than two years, and two of the main members of the cast, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Keitel" title="Harvey Keitel">Harvey Keitel</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh" title="Jennifer Jason Leigh">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>, were replaced in the course of the filming. Although it is set in New York City, the film was mostly shot on London soundstages, with little location shooting. Shots of Manhattan itself were pickup shots filmed in New York City by a second-unit crew. Because of Kubrick's secrecy about the film, mostly inaccurate rumors abounded about its plot and content. Most especially, the story's sexual content provoked speculation, some journalists writing that it would be "the sexiest film ever made." The casting of then celebrity-actor supercouple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a husband-wife couple in the film increased the pre-release journalistic hyperbole.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, like <i>Lolita</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> before it, faced censorship before release. In the United States and Canada, digitally manufactured silhouette figures were strategically placed to mask explicit copulation scenes so as to secure an R rating from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</a>. In Europe, and the rest of the world, the film has been released uncut, in its original form. The October 2007 DVD reissue contains the uncut version, making it available to North American audiences for the first time.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1956, after MGM turned down Harris and Kubrick's request to film <i>Paths of Glory</i>, they invited him to look through their other properties. Harris and Kubrick discovered <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_Zweig" title="Stefan Zweig">Stefan Zweig</a>'s novel <i>The Burning Secret</i>, in which a young baron tries to seduce a young Jewish woman by first befriending her twelve-year-old son, who eventually becomes wise to the situation. Kubrick was very excited about this novel and hired novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calder_Willingham" title="Calder Willingham">Calder Willingham</a> to produce a screenplay, but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_Code" title="Production Code">Production Code</a> restrictions made the project impossible.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick had earlier been interested in adapting another Calder Willingham novel (<i>Natural Child</i>), but quickly realized it could not be done within the Production Code.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> announced on October 18, 1956 that producer Frank Rosenberg had bought rights to Charles Neider's novel <i>The Authentic Death of Hendry Jones</i> for $40,000. Two years later, Pennebaker Inc., <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>'s independent production company, bought the rights to the novel as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah" title="Sam Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>'s first-draft screenplay adaptation for $150,000. Even at this time, it was announced that Brando might direct.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later that year, Kubrick was announced as director of <i>Gun's Up</i>, the working title for the production. Shortly after this announcement, the name of the film was changed to <i>One-Eyed Jacks</i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pina_Pellicer" title="Pina Pellicer">Pina Pellicer</a> was announced as "the unanimous choice of Brando, Rosenberg, and Kubrick" to play the female lead.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On November 20, 1958, Kubrick quit as director of <i>One-Eyed Jacks</i>, stating that he had the utmost respect for Marlon Brando as one of "the world's foremost artists" but had recently acquired the rights to Nabokov's <i>Lolita</i> and wanted to begin production work immediately in light of this wonderful opportunity. The film was completed with directorial credit given to Marlon Brando.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the success of <i>2001</i>, Kubrick planned a large-scale <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographical_film" title="Biographical film">biographical film</a> about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_I" title="Napoleon I">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. He conducted research, read books about the French Emperor, and wrote a preliminary screenplay (which has become available on the Internet). With the help of assistants, he meticulously created a card catalog of the places and deeds of Napoleon's inner circle during its operative years. Kubrick scouted locations, planning to film large portions of the film on location in France, and in the UK studios. He was also going to film the battle scenes in Romania, where he enlisted the help of the Romanian army, which gave Kubrick 40,000 army soldiers, and 10,000 cavalry soldiers to film the battle scenes with paper costumes. In a conversation with the British Film Institute, Kubrick's brother-in-law <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harlan" title="Jan Harlan">Jan Harlan</a>, stated that at the time the film was about to go into production, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hemmings" title="David Hemmings">David Hemmings</a> was Kubrick's favorite choice to play Napoleon, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> was his favorite choice to play Josephine. In notes to his financial backers, preserved in The Kubrick Archives, Kubrick told them he was unsure how his Napoleon film would turn out, but that he expected to create "the best movie ever made." Ultimately, the project was canceled for the prohibitive cost of location filming, the Western release of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Bondarchuk" title="Sergei Bondarchuk">Sergei Bondarchuk</a>'s epic film version of Leo Tolstoy's novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_(1965_film)" title="War and Peace (1965 film)">War and Peace</a></i> (1968), and the commercial failure of Bondarchuk's Napoleon-themed film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_(film)" title="Waterloo (film)">Waterloo</a></i> (1970). Much of his historical research would influence <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Lyndon" title="Barry Lyndon">Barry Lyndon</a></i> (1975), the storyline of which ends in 1789, about 15 years before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars" title="Napoleonic Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a> began. As late as 1987, Kubrick stated that he had not given up on the project, mentioning that he had read almost 500 books on the historical figure and that he was convinced that a film worthy of the subject had not yet appeared.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As early as 1976, Kubrick wanted to make a film about the Holocaust, trying to persuade <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Bashevis_Singer" title="Isaac Bashevis Singer">Isaac Bashevis Singer</a> to contribute an original screenplay. Kubrick sought a "dramatic structure that compressed the complex and vast information into the story of an individual who represented the essence of this man-made hell." Singer declined, saying, "I don't know the first thing about the Holocaust." In the early 1990s, Kubrick almost went into production on a film of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Begley" title="Louis Begley">Louis Begley</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_Lies" title="Wartime Lies">Wartime Lies</a></i>, the story of a boy and his aunt in hiding during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>. The first-draft screenplay, titled "Aryan Papers", had been penned by Kubrick himself. <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> co-screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Herr" title="Michael Herr">Michael Herr</a> reports that Kubrick had considered casting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts" title="Julia Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uma_Thurman" title="Uma Thurman">Uma Thurman</a> as the aunt. Eventually, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johanna_ter_Steege" title="Johanna ter Steege">Johanna ter Steege</a> was cast as the aunt and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mazzello" title="Joseph Mazzello">Joseph Mazzello</a> as the young boy, with Kubrick even travelling to the Czech city of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brno" title="Brno">Brno</a> as a possible location for wartime <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw" title="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. But Kubrick chose not to make the film due to the release of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s Holocaust-themed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i> in 1993. In addition, according to Kubrick's wife, Christiane, the subject itself had become too depressing and difficult for the director. Kubrick eventually concluded that an accurate film about the Holocaust was beyond the capacity of cinema and abandoned the project in 1995 and turned his attention back to <i>A.I.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout the 1980s and early '90s, Kubrick collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aldiss" title="Brian Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a> on an expansion of his short story "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Toys_Last_All_Summer_Long" title="Super-Toys Last All Summer Long">Super-Toys Last All Summer Long</a>" into a three-act film, along with other writers, such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sara_Maitland" title="Sara Maitland">Sara Maitland</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Watson_(author)" title="Ian Watson (author)">Ian Watson</a>, under various names, including "Pinocchio" and "Artificial Intelligence.". It was a futuristic fairy-tale about a robot that resembles and behaves as a child, sold as a temporary surrogate to a family whose real son is in suspended animation with a deadly disease. The story focuses on the efforts of the robot to become a 'real boy' in a manner similar to Pinocchio.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick reportedly held long telephone discussions with Steven Spielberg regarding the film, and, according to Spielberg, at one point stated that the subject matter was closer to Spielberg's sensibilities than his. In 1999, following Kubrick's death, Spielberg took the various drafts and notes left by Kubrick and his writers and composed a new screenplay and, in association with what remained of Kubrick's production unit, made the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I.

The film was released in June 2001.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film contains a posthumous producing credit for Stanley Kubrick at the beginning and the brief dedication "For Stanley Kubrick" at the end. The film contains many recurrent Kubrick motifs, such as an omniscient narrator, an extreme form of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure" title="Three-act structure">three-act structure</a>, the themes of humanity and inhumanity, and a sardonic view of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_psychology" title="Freudian psychology">Freudian psychology</a>. In addition, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>' score contains many allusions to pieces heard in other Kubrick films.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A number of screenplays remain for which Kubrick was either commissioned or wrote for unsuccessful projects, include <i>The German Lieutenant</i> (co-written with Richard Adams), featuring a group of German soldiers in a mission during the final days of World War II; <i>I Stole 16 Million Dollars,</i> about notorious 1930s bank robber <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Sutton" title="Willie Sutton">Willie Sutton</a> (the film was to be made by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>' Bryna production company, despite Douglas believing the script was poorly written, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> was approached for the lead); and a first draft of a script about the Confederate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_S._Mosby" title="John S.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick is reported to have been fascinated by the career of Nazi filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veit_Harlan" title="Veit Harlan">Veit Harlan</a>, his wife's uncle, and to have contemplated a film about the social circle surrounding <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Goebbels" title="Joseph Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>. Although Kubrick worked on it for several years, this never got further than a rough story outline.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick wanted to make a film based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umberto_Eco" title="Umberto Eco">Umberto Eco</a>'s 1988 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foucault%27s_Pendulum" title="Foucault's Pendulum">Foucault's Pendulum</a></i>, but Eco declined because of his dissatisfaction with the filming of his earlier novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose" title="The Name of the Rose">The Name of the Rose</a></i> and Kubrick's unwillingness to allow him to write the screenplay himself; after Kubrick died, Eco would admit he regretted his decision.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before moving onto <i>2001</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Southern" title="Terry Southern">Terry Southern</a> suggested that Kubrick should make a high-budget pornographic film called <i>Blue Movie</i> in an attempt to take the genre and reinvent it. He decided not to do it, believing that he did not have the temperament for pornographic cinema and didn't think he could successfully reinvent the genre enough to truly elevate it. At this time, Southern started work on a novel that would not be published until 1970, also entitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Movie_(novel)" title="Blue Movie (novel)">Blue Movie</a></i>, about a highly regarded art film director named Boris Adrian who attempts just such a film (the book is dedicated to Kubrick).</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick also toyed with the idea of adapting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfume_(novel)" title="Perfume (novel)">Perfume</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_S%C3%BCskind" title="Patrick SÃ¼skind">Patrick SÃ¼skind</a>, a book he greatly enjoyed, though nothing came of it.

However, Kubrick did on several occasions work with the same actor more than once. In lead roles, Sterling Hayden appeared in both <i>The Killing</i> and <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, Peter Sellers in <i>Lolita</i> and <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, and Kirk Douglas in <i>Paths of Glory</i> and <i>Spartacus</i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of Kubrick's longest collaborations was with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Vitali" title="Leon Vitali">Leon Vitali</a>, who, after playing the older Lord Bullingdon in <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, became Kubrick's personal assistant, working as the casting director on his following films, and supervising film-to-video transfers for Kubrick. He also appeared in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, playing the ominous Red Cloak, who confronts Tom Cruise during the infamous orgy scene. Since Kubrick's death, Vitali has overseen the restoration of both picture and sound elements for most of Kubrick's films.

His stepdaughter Katharina has cameos in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, and her character's son in the latter is played by her real son.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Style_and_trademarks">Style and trademarks</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stanley Kubrick's films have several trademark characteristics. All but his first two full-length films and <i>2001</i> were adapted from existing novels (<i>2001</i> being based on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sentinel_(short_story)" title="The Sentinel (short story)">The Sentinel</a></i> as well as having its own planned novelization), and he occasionally wrote screenplays in collaboration with writers (usually novelists, but a journalist in the case of <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>) who had limited screenwriting experience. Many of his films had voice-over narration, sometimes taken verbatim from the novel. With or without narration, all of his films contain extensive character's-point-of-view footage. The closing of films with "The End" went out of style with the advent of long closing credits, but Kubrick continued to put it at the end of the credits, long after the rest of the film industry stopped using it. On the other hand, Kubrick occasionally dispensed with opening credits (in <i>Space Odyssey</i> and <i>Clockwork Orange</i>) long before the industry started doing so commonly. His credits are always a slide show. His only rolling credits are the opening credits to <i>The Shining</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick paid close attention to the releases of his films in other countries. Not only did he have complete control of the dubbing cast, but sometimes alternative material was shot for international releasesâ€”in <i>The Shining</i>, the text on the typewriter pages was re-shot for the countries in which the film was released; in <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, the newspaper headlines and paper notes were re-shot for different languages. Since Kubrick's death, no new voice translations are allowed to be produced for any of the films he had control of; in countries where no authorized dubs exist, only subtitles are allowed for translation. Kubrick also closely supervised the actual translation of the script into foreign languages.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beginning with <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, all of his films except <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> used mostly pre-recorded classical music, in two cases electronically altered by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Carlos" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>. He also often used merry-sounding pop music in an ironic way during scenes depicting devastation and destruction, especially in the closing credits or end sequences of a film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his review of <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, Roger Ebert noted that many Kubrick films have a facial closeup of an unraveling character in which the character's head is tilted down and his eyes are tilted up. Kubrick also extensively employed wide angle shots, character tracking shots, zoom shots, and shots down tall parallel walls.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of Kubrick's films have back-references to previous Kubrick films. The best-known examples of this are the appearance of the soundtrack album for <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> appearing in the record store in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> and Quilty's joke about Spartacus in <i>Lolita</i>. Less obvious is the reference to a painter named Ludovico in <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, Ludovico being the name of the conditioning treatment in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Almost all Stanley Kubrick movies have a scene in or just outside a bathroom. (Oddly, the most cited example of this in <i>2001</i> is Dr. Floyd's becoming stymied by the Zero-Gravity Toilet en route to the moon, but not David Bowman's exploration [while still wearing his spacesuit] of the bathroom adjacent to his celestial bedroom after his journey through the Star Gate.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> employs a device called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRM-114" title="CRM-114">CRM-114</a></i>, and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> has a sound-alike medicine called <i>Serum 114</i>, numerous and oft-repeated claims that the numbers 114 appear in other Kubrick films are apocryphal. <i>CRM-114</i> is also used in the source novel <i>Red Alert</i>, upon which <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> is based, although claims have been made that the acronym appears in Kubrick's earlier film <i>The Killing</i>. Nonetheless, in a remarkable case of a director's influence over popular culture through an exaggerated urban legend, there is in honor of this Kubrick trademark, an e-mail spam filtering system, a progressive rock band, a right-wing website, a sound amplifier in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future" title="Back to the Future">Back to the Future</a></i>, a catalog code in the TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(TV_series)" title="Heroes (TV series)">Heroes</a></i>, and a weapon in the TV series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></i>, all named <i>CRM-114</i>, as well as a short film called <i>Serum 114</i>.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Aspect_ratio">Aspect ratio</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been a longstanding debate regarding the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> releases of Kubrick's films, specifically regarding the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> of many of the films. The primary point of contention relates to his final five films: <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's initial involvement with home video mastering of his films was a result of television screenings of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. Because the film was shot in 65Â mm, the composition of each shot was compromised by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-and-scan" title="Pan-and-scan">pan-and-scan</a> method of transferring a wide-screen image to fit a 1.33:1 television set.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first mastering of these five films was in 2000 as part of the "Stanley Kubrick Collection", consisting of <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> (in association with Sony Pictures), <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>. Kubrick oversaw the video masters in 1989 for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Home_Video" title="Warner Home Video">Warner Home Video</a>, and approved of 1.33:1 transfers for all of the films except for <i>2001</i>, which was letterboxed.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick never approved a 1.85:1 video transfer of any of his films; when he died in 1999, DVDs and the 16Ã—9 format were only beginning to become popular in the US. Most people were accustomed to seeing movies fill their television screen; in July 2007, less than 10% of US households had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-definition_television" title="High-definition television">High-definition television (HDTV)</a> (16Ã—9 ready) sets. Warner Home Video chose to release these films with the transfers that Kubrick had explicitly approved.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2007, Warner Home Video remastered <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> in High-Definition, releasing the titles on DVD, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD_DVD" title="HD DVD">HD DVD</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc" title="Blu-ray Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>. All were released in 16Ã—9 anamorphic transfers, preserving the theatrical 1.85:1 aspect ratios for all of the flat films except <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, which was transferred at the aspect ratio of 1.66:1.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In regards to the Warner Bros. titles, there is little studio documentation that is public about them other than instructions given to projectionists on initial release; however, Kubrick's storyboards for <i>The Shining</i> do prove that he composed the film for wide-screen. In instructions given to photographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alcott" title="John Alcott">John Alcott</a> in one panel, Kubrick writes: <i>THE FRAME IS EXACTLY 1.85-1. Obviously you compose for that but protect the full 1.33-1 area.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">More confusion results regarding Kubrick's non-Warner distributed titles. During the days of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laserdisc" title="Laserdisc">laserdisc</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Criterion_Collection" title="The Criterion Collection">The Criterion Collection</a> released six Kubrick films. <i>Spartacus</i> and <i>2001</i> were both native 70Â mm releases (exhibited in their roadshow engagements at a ratio of 2.20:1) at the same ratio as their subsequent DVD releases, and <i>The Killing</i> and <i>Paths of Glory</i> were both transferred at 1.33:1, despite the latter being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_matte" title="Hard matte">hard matted</a> extensively. Both pictures were theatrically projected at an aspect ratio of 1.85:1.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Dr. Strangelove</i> and <i>Lolita</i> were also transferred at 1.33:1, although <i>Strangelove</i> exhibits a number of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_matte" title="Hard matte">hard mattes</a> at a ratio of 1.66:1 in second-unit footage. This is sometimes falsely attributed to the use of stock footage in <i>Strangelove</i>. Both films were presented theatrically at ratios of 1.85:1.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DVD versions of <i>The Killing</i> and <i>Paths of Glory</i> released by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Home_Entertainment" title="MGM Home Entertainment">MGM Home Entertainment</a> retained the same 1.33:1 aspect ratio as the laserdisc versions. The Criterion Collection DVD and Blu-ray editions of <i>Paths of Glory</i> feature a 1.66:1 aspect ratio. The initial DVD releases of <i>Strangelove</i> maintained the 1.33:1, Kubrick-approved transfer, but for the most recent DVD and Blu-ray editions, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Home_Entertainment" title="Sony Pictures Home Entertainment">Sony Pictures Home Entertainment</a> replaced it with a new, digitally remastered anamorphic transfer with an aspect ratio of 1.66:1. All DVD releases of <i>Lolita</i> to date have been at a uniform 1.66:1 aspect ratio, and the expectation is that future releases will retain this aspect ratio.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Laserdisc releases of <i>2001</i> were presented in a slightly different aspect ratio than the original film. The film was shot in 65Â mm, which has a ratio of 2.20:1, but many theaters could only show it in 35Â mm reduction prints, which were presented at a ratio of 2.35:1. Thus, the picture was slightly modified for the 35Â mm prints. The laserdisc releases maintained the 2.20:1 ratio, but the source material was an already cropped 35Â mm print; thus, the edges were slightly cropped and the top and bottom of the image slightly opened up. This seems to have been corrected with the most recent DVD release, which was newly remastered from a 70Â mm print.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick infrequently discussed personal matters in interview, and rarely spoke publicly at all. Over time, the gamut of his public image in the media ranged from a reclusive genius to a megalomaniacal lunatic shut off from the world. Since his death, Kubrick's friends and family have publicly denied both of these stereotypes. It is clear that the director left behind a strong family and a circle of close friends, and many of those who worked for him have spoken in his favor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's famous reclusive nature is largely a myth, and may have resulted from his aversion to air travel. Despite once holding a pilot's license, Kubrick had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_flying" title="Fear of flying">fear of flying</a> and refused to take airplane trips. As a result, he rarely left England in the last forty years of his life. In addition, Kubrick shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, resulting in little media coverage of him as a personality. Upon purchasing the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childwickbury" title="Childwickbury">Childwickbury</a> Manor in Hertfordshire, England, Kubrick set up his life so that family and business were one. He purchased top-of-the-line film editing equipment and owned a number of cameras, which he sometimes used on his own movies. Children and animals would frequently come in and out of the room as he worked on a script or met with an actor. His appearance was not well-known in his later years, to the extent that a British man named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Conway" title="Alan Conway">Alan Conway</a> successfully impersonated Kubrick in order to meet several well-known actors and get into fancy clubs. Conway is the subject of the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_Me_Kubrick" title="Colour Me Kubrick">Colour Me Kubrick</a></i> (2005), written by Kubrick's assistant Anthony Frewin and directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brian_Cook_(assistant_director)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Brian Cook (assistant director) (page does not exist)">Brian Cook</a>, Kubrick's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistant_director" title="Assistant director">First Assistant Director</a> for 25 years.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his aversion to international travel, Kubrick was in constant contact with family members and business associates, often by telephone, and called his collaborators at all hours of the day and night for conversations that lasted from under a minute to several hours. Many of Kubrick's admirers and friends spoke of these telephone conversations with great affection and nostalgia after his death, especially Michael Herr and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. In his memoir of Kubrick, Herr stated that dozens of people have claimed to have spoken to Kubrick on the day of his death and remarked that "I believe all of them." Kubrick also frequently invited people to his house, ranging from actors to close friends, admired film directors, writers, and intellectuals.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since his death, efforts by his friends and family have been made to attempt to reverse the popular image of him as a recluse. However he was known to rarely travel, by car or train, outside his estate. Moreover, his obsessive, perfectionistic style, and specific, intense interests have led some researchers to speculate he may have had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger%27s_Syndrome" title="Asperger's Syndrome">Asperger's Syndrome</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was little-known by the public during Kubrick's life that he was also an animal lover. He owned many dogs and cats, and showed an extraordinary affection for them. He is reported to have owned dogs his whole life and Kubrick's widow, Christiane, in her book version of <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life In Pictures</i>, wrote that Kubrick brought his cats onto film sets and editing rooms with him in order to spend more time with them. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Modine" title="Matthew Modine">Matthew Modine</a> remembers Kubrick's being deeply upset when a family of rabbits was accidentally killed during the making of <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>. Kubrick was so beside himself that he cancelled shooting for the rest of the day. Philip Kaplan, one of Kubrick's lawyers and friends, told the story that Stanley once cancelled, at the last moment, a meeting with him and another lawyer who had flown to London from the United States because he had sat up all night with a dying cat and was in no shape to participate. Also, according to Kaplan, the huge kitchen table at Kubrick's home in Harpenden (Hertfordshire, United Kingdom) was supported by an undulating base with interior spaces, and housed within each curved space was a dog, most of whom were of no recognizable breed, and some not notably friendly to strangers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick had a reputation for being tactless and rude to those he worked with. Some of Kubrick's collaborators complained that his personality was cold and that he lacked sympathy for the feelings of other people. Although Kubrick became close friends with <i>Clockwork Orange</i> star Malcolm McDowell during filming, Kubrick abruptly terminated the friendship soon after the film was complete. McDowell was deeply hurt by this, and the schism between the two men lasted until Kubrick's death. Science fiction writer Brian Aldiss was fired from Kubrick's never-completed project <i>A.I.</i> for vacationing with his family in violation of his contract, even though Kubrick had put the project on hold at the time. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Earl_Jones" title="James Earl Jones">James Earl Jones</a>, despite his admiration for Kubrick on an artistic level, spoke negatively of his experience on <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, saying that Kubrick was disrespectful to actors, using them as instruments in a grand design rather than allowing them to be creative artists in their own right. George C. Scott, who admired Kubrick in retrospect for reportedly being one of the few people who could routinely beat him at chess, famously resented Kubrick's using Scott's most over-the-top performances for the final cut of <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> after being promised by Kubrick that they were warmups and would not actually be in the movie. Kubrick's employees and crew members have stated that he was notorious for not complimenting anyone, and rarely showed admiration for his coworkers for fear it would make them complacent. Kubrick complimented them on their work only after the movie was finished, unless he felt their work was "genius." The only actors that Kubrick called "genius" were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell" title="Malcolm McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Michael Herr, in his otherwise positive memoir of his friendship with Kubrick, complained that Kubrick was extremely cheap and very greedy about money. He stated that Kubrick was a "terrible man to do business with" and that the director was upset until the day he died that Jack Nicholson made more money from <i>The Shining</i> than he did. Kirk Douglas often commented on Kubrick's unwillingness to compromise, his out-of-control ego, and his ruthless determination to make a film his own distinct work of art instead of a group effort. However, Douglas has acknowledged that a large part of his dislike for Kubrick was caused by the director's consistently negative statements about <i>Spartacus</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of those who worked with Kubrick have spoken kindly of him since his death, including coworkers and friends <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Johnson" title="Diane Johnson">Diane Johnson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Turkel" title="Joe Turkel">Joe Turkel</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Con_Pederson&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Con Pederson (page does not exist)">Con Pederson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Solomon" title="Carl Solomon">Carl Solomon</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anthony_Frewin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Anthony Frewin (page does not exist)">Anthony Frewin</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Birkin" title="Andrew Birkin">Andrew Birkin</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Watson_(author)" title="Ian Watson (author)">Ian Watson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Milius" title="John Milius">John Milius</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Pook" title="Jocelyn Pook">Jocelyn Pook</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Pollack" title="Sydney Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Lee_Ermey" title="R.

Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick, and Matthew Modine's book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Full_Metal_Jacket_Diary&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Full Metal Jacket Diary (page does not exist)">Full Metal Jacket Diary</a></i> show a much kinder, saner, and warmer version of Kubrick than the conventional view of him as cold, demanding, and impersonal. In a series of interviews found on the DVD of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, a teary-eyed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> remembers Kubrick with great affection; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Kidman" title="Nicole Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> shares her sentiments. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Winters" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a>, when asked what she thought of him, answered: "A gift." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Duvall" title="Shelley Duvall">Shelley Duvall</a>, who played Wendy in <i>The Shining</i>, had a rocky relationship with Kubrick, but said in retrospect that it was a great experience that made her smarterâ€”though she'd never want to do it again. Malcolm McDowell acknowledged in retrospect that some of his statements about Kubrick were "unfair" and were a "cry out" to Kubrick to reconnect with him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's immediate family felt that the common perception of him as an eccentric reclusive misanthrope were entirely off-the-mark stereotypes. His stepdaughter Katharina recalls that her sister Anya once stated that "the more she reads about daddy the more she thinks that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> was probably a perfectly normal person." When his widow, Christiane, was asked which books on Kubrick were not reliable, she singled out Frederic Raphael's <i>Eyes Wide Open: A Memoir of Stanley Kubrick</i> and John Baxter's <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Biography</i> (not to be confused with the identically titled book by Vincent LoBrutto). The posthumous family production of the documentary and book <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures</i> (film documentary directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Harlan" title="Jan Harlan">Jan Harlan</a>, book tie-in written by Christiane Kubrick nÃ©e Harlan) was partly intended to offset the negative impressions created by these works.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his memoir of Kubrick, Michael Herr, his friend and co-writer of the screenplay for <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, wrote:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herr recalls that Kubrick was sometimes akin to a 19th-century liberal-humanist, that he found <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Kristol" title="Irving Kristol">Irving Kristol</a>'s definition of a neoconservative as a "liberal mugged by reality" to be hysterically funny, that he distrusted almost all authority, and that he was a Social Darwinist.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herr further wrote that Kubrick owned guns and did not think that war was an entirely bad thing. In the documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick:_A_Life_in_Pictures" title="Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures">Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures</a></i>, Herr says "â€¦he also accepted that it was perfectly okay to acknowledge that, of all the things war is, it's also very beautiful." The writer said of initial reactions to <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> that "The political left will call <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubrick" title="Kubrick">Kubrick</a> a fascist." In a 1987 interview with Gene Siskel, called <i>Candidly Kubrick</i>, Kubrick said, "<i>Full Metal Jacket</i> suggests there is more to say about war than it is just bad." He added that everything serious the drill instructor says, such as "A rifle is only a tool, it is a hard heart that kills", is completely true.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though some have said Kubrick disliked America, Michael Herr says that America was all he talked about and that he often thought of moving back. Herr wrote that Kubrick was sent VHS tapes from American friends of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football" title="American football">NFL Football</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld" title="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, and other television shows that he could not get in the United Kingdom. Kubrick told Siskel that he was not anti-American and thought that America was a good country, though he did not think that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was a good President. In the interview, he also predicted an economic meltdown worldwide by pointing out to Siskel that most of the major banks in the United States held dubious foreign bonds as collateral and huge third world loans treated as assets. Kubrick likened this to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen" title="Hans Christian Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a> fairy tale about the "Emperor's New Clothes", and felt even during the Cold War, an economic collapse was more worrisome and imminent than nuclear annihilation was. As far as Kubrick's views on welfare and taxation, according to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Watson_(author)" title="Ian Watson (author)">Ian Watson</a>, Kubrick said of the pre-1997 socialist Labour Party that "If the Labourites ever get in, Iâ€™ll leave the country." Watson claims that Kubrick was extremely opposed to taxes on the rich and to welfare in general.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's earlier work is seen by Pauline Kael as more socially liberal than his later work. The early films embody liberal ideals, and the satire of government and military in <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> seems to point to a liberal political perspective. Similarly, film analyst Glenn Perusek thinks Kubrick's earlier <i>Paths of Glory</i> reflects a Rousseauist vision of man with natural human sympathy crushed by the artifice of society; later Kubrick films abandon that perspective. While Kael viewed <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> as a liberal film, Kagan disagrees, holding that film to be written from the point of view of a detached realist, lacking the overt liberalism of similar anti-war films of the era such as <i>On the Beach</i> or <i>Fail-Safe</i>. Kubrick's more mature works are more pessimistic and suspicious of the so-called innate goodness of mankind, and are critical of stances based on that positive assessment. For example, in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, the police are as violent and vulgar as the droogs, and Kubrick depicts both the subversive Leftist writer Mr. Alexander and the authoritarian status quo Minister of the Interior as manipulative and sinister. Kubrick commented regarding <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When <i>New York Times</i> writer Fred M. Hechinger wrote a piece that declared <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist" title="Fascist">fascist</a>", Kubrick responded:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick quoted extensively from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ardrey" title="Robert Ardrey">Robert Ardrey</a>, author of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=African_Genesis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="African Genesis (page does not exist)">African Genesis</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Social_Contract_(Ardrey_book)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Social Contract (Ardrey book) (page does not exist)">The Social Contract</a></i>â€”not to be confused with Rousseau'sâ€”and author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Koestler" title="Arthur Koestler">Arthur Koestler</a>, who is famous for writing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_in_the_Machine" title="The Ghost in the Machine">The Ghost in the Machine</a></i>. Both authors (Koestler through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology" title="Psychology">psychology</a> and Ardrey through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology" title="Anthropology">anthropology</a>) searched for the cause of humanity's capacity for death and destruction, and both, like Kubrick, were suspicious of the liberal belief in the innate goodness of mankind. Ardrey and Kubrick both attribute this to Rousseau, who, in Ardrey's words, "Fathered the romantic fallacy" and Behaviourism, especially what they consider "radical Behaviourism", which they blame primarily on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner" title="B. F. Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>. In his interview with <i>The New York Times</i>, Kubrick stated that his view of man was closer to those of Christianity than to humanism or Jewish theology, saying, "I mean, it's essentially Christian theology anyway, that view of man."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick appeared to believe that freedom is still worth pursuing even if mankind is ultimately ignoble, and that evil on the part of the individualâ€”however undesirableâ€”is still preferable in contrast to the evil of a totalitarian society. Kubrick said in an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel" title="Gene Siskel">Gene Siskel</a>:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stanley Kubrick was of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism" title="Judaism">Jewish</a> descent, but his family did not practice religion at all. Indeed though his father's real name was Jacob, he went by Jacques or Jack as a move towards American assimilation. When asked by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Ciment" title="Michel Ciment">Michel Ciment</a> in an interview if he had a religious upbringing, Kubrick replied: "No, not at all."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick is often said to have been an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism" title="Atheism">atheist</a>. This may or may not be true. In Kubrick's interview with Craig McGregor, he said:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When asked by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eric_Nordern&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Eric Nordern (page does not exist)">Eric Nordern</a> in Kubrick's interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy" title="Playboy">Playboy</a></i> if <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> was a religious film, Kubrick elaborated:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the same interview, he also blames the poor critical reaction to <i>2001</i> as follows:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In an interview with William Kloman of <i>The New York Times</i>, when asked why there is hardly any dialogue in <i>2001</i>, Kubrick explained:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stephen King recalled Kubrick calling him late at night while he was filming <i>The Shining</i> and Kubrick asked him, "Do you believe in God?" King said that he had answered in the affirmative, but has had three different versions of what happened next. One time, he said that Kubrick simply hung up on him. On other occasions, he claimed Kubrick said, "I knew it", and then hung up on him. On yet another occasion, King claimed that Kubrick said, before hanging up, "No, I don't think there is a God." In more recent interviews, King has had yet another version of the "God" story, in which Kubrick calls King and asks him if he thinks ghost stories are optimistic because they all suggest there is life after death. King replies, "What about hell?" There is a pause and Kubrick says, "I do not believe in hell."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, Katharina Kubrick Hobbs was asked by alt.movies.kubrick if Stanley Kubrick believed in God. Here is her response:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures</i>, Jack Nicholson recalls that Kubrick said <i>The Shining</i> is an overall optimistic story because "anything that says there's anything after death is ultimately an optimistic story."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three of Stanley Kubrick's films have had their source material re-adapted in some fashion: Anthony Burgess's subsequent stage adaptation of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> in 1990, which he hoped would be considered a more definitive adaptation than Kubrick's film; the Stephen King written and produced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(TV_miniseries)" title="The Shining (TV miniseries)">television miniseries</a> of <i>The Shining</i>, which he hoped would stand as the authorized adaptation; and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_(1997_film)" title="Lolita (1997 film)">Adrian Lyne's adaptation</a> of <i>Lolita</i>, which had the blessing of Vladimir Nabokov's son, Dmitri (who echoed his father's moderate misgivings about Kubrick's version). Both Burgess and King overtly stated that they were annoyed by Kubrick's denying their lead characters (Alex DeLarge and Jack Torrance, respectively) a final redemption that was present in the source material, but absent from Kubrick's adaptation.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Legacy">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick made only thirteen feature films in his life. His oeuvre was comparatively low in number (compared to contemporaries such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini" title="Federico Fellini">Federico Fellini</a>) due to his methodical and meticulous dedication to every aspect of film production. A number of his films are recognized as seminal classics within their genre.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Five of Stanley Kubrick's films were nominated for Academy Awards in various categories, including Best Picture for <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, and <i>Barry Lyndon</i>, and Best Director for <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, and <i>Barry Lyndon</i>. <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> received numerous technical awards, including a BAFTA award for cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth and an Academy Award for best visual effects, which Kubrick (as director of special effects on the film) received.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most awards for which Kubrick's films were nominated tended to be in the areas of cinematography, art design, screenwriting, and music. However, only four of his films were nominated for their acting performances, notably <i>Lolita</i>, getting three acting nominations from the Golden Globes, and Peter Sellers getting nominated for both an Oscar and a BAFTA for his triple roles in <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>. Of all his movies, only <i>Spartacus</i> rewarded a cast member with an acting award.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All Kubrick films from <i>Paths of Glory</i> to the end of his career were nominated for at least one Golden Globe or Oscar (along with several BAFTA nominations) with the notable exception of <i>The Shining</i> which was actually nominated for the infamous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razzie" title="Razzie">Razzie</a> award. (This was the first year of the Raspberry awards which at the time were voted on only by a few friends of Raspberry founder, John Wilson, not the international committee of several hundred that includes professional critics and industry professionals that it does today.) Ironically, at least two published books, <i>The Wolf at the Door</i> by Jay Cocks and <i>Kubrick, inside a film artist's maze</i> by Thomas Nelson, consider <i>The Shining</i> to be a kind of master key to Kubrick's whole body of work in which all of Kubrick's philosophical preoccupations merge into a grand synthesis.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1997, three of Kubrick's films were selected by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years%E2%80%A6100_Movies" title="AFI's 100 Yearsâ€¦100 Movies">their list of the 100 Greatest Movies in America</a>: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i> at #22, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></i> at #26 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(film)" title="A Clockwork Orange (film)">A Clockwork Orange</a></i> at #46.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many of Kubrick's films initially received lukewarm reviews, only to be hailed as major and seminal classics decades later. Film critics Andrew Sarris and Pauline Kael were consistently highly dismissive of Kubrick, often considering him as impersonal and misanthropic. Writer Mark Browning has noted that critics seem divided between those that consider him "immensely profound" or "just plain pretentious." Likewise, Tony Mills in the Sunday Times Book review said he is "depending on who you ask either the greatest film director since Orson Welles or...a hypnotically pretentious fake". Initially, Roger Ebert gave a poor review of <i>The Shining</i> which now Ebert has canonized in his series of reviews of great films. It has been argued that this frequent shift in opinion is due to the consistently idiosyncratic and unconventional character of his film-making style, and this also accounts for his enormous influence on the film community. (See the section on "Tributes from filmmakers" below.) Ronnie Lankford notes "It is fascinating, when reflecting upon Kubrick, how many times he made a seminal film." which approached subjects in a new way. In the same essay he writes,</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For Kubrick, written dialogue is one element to be put in balance with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_sc%C3%A8ne" title="Mise en scÃ¨ne">mise en scÃ¨ne</a> (set arrangements), music, and especially, editing. Inspired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsevolod_Pudovkin" title="Vsevolod Pudovkin">Pudovkin</a>'s treatise on film acting, Kubrick realized that one could create a performance in the editing room and often re-direct a film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick's method of operating thus became a quest for an emergent vision in the editing room, when all the elements of a film could be assembled. The price of this method, beginning as early as <i>Spartacus</i> (when he first had an ample budget for film stock), was endless exploratory re-shooting of scenes that was an exhaustive investigation of all possible variations of a scene.This enabled him to walk into the editing room with copious options. John Baxter has written:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick also pioneered the use of long takes extended over the course of a picture, such as the extended tricycle riding sequence in <i>The Shining</i> or the long pullback from Alex's face at the beginning of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. While not an unknown technique before Kubrick, it became seen in the film community as a Kubrickian trademark.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leading directors, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron" title="James Cameron">James Cameron</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott">Ridley Scott</a>, have cited Kubrick as a source of inspiration, and in the case of Spielberg, collaboration. On the DVD of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, Steven Spielberg, in an interview, comments on Kubrick that "nobody could shoot a picture better in history" but the way that Kubrick "tells a story is antithetical to the way we are accustomed to receiving stories". Writing in the introduction to a recent edition of Michel Ciment's <i>Kubrick</i>, film director Martin Scorsese has noted that most of Kubrick's films were misunderstood and under-appreciated when first released. Then came a dawning recognition that they were masterful works unlike any other films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even today, Kubrick continues to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" title="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Fincher" title="David Fincher">David Fincher</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_del_Toro" title="Guillermo del Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lynch" title="David Lynch">David Lynch</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Von_Trier" title="Lars Von Trier">Lars Von Trier</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Linklater" title="Richard Linklater">Richard Linklater</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Mendes" title="Sam Mendes">Sam Mendes</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Schumacher" title="Joel Schumacher">Joel Schumacher</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hackford" title="Taylor Hackford">Taylor Hackford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mann_(director)" title="Michael Mann (director)">Michael Mann</a>  and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_A._Romero" title="George A. Romero">George A. Romero</a>. Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, For example, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Glazer" title="Jonathan Glazer">Jonathan Glazer</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_(film)" title="Birth (film)">Birth</a></i> and music video <i>The Universal</i> contain many visual references to Kubrick.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, others, such as the filmmakers of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remodernist_film" title="Remodernist film">remodernist film</a> movement, have been critical of Kubrick's work, described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Richards" title="Jesse Richards">Jesse Richards</a> as "boring and dishonest". Peter Rinaldi, in his essay on the <i>Remodernist Film Manifesto</i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mungbeing" title="Mungbeing">Mungbeing</a>, <i>The Shore as Seen from the Deep Sea</i>, defends the manifesto, writing:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick was both a great fan of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> and in friendly contact with the show's producers. Analysts of the show argue that The Simpsons contains more references to many films of Stanley Kubrick than any other pop culture phenomenon. References abound not only to <i>2001</i>, <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, and <i>The Shining</i> but also to <i>Spartacus</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, <i>Lolita</i>, and <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>. It has been noted that while references to "fantastic fiction" in <i>The Simpsons</i> are copious, "there are two masters of the genre whose impact on <i>The Simpsons</i> supersedes that of all others: Stanley Kubrick and Edgar Allan Poe." Similarly, it has been observed that</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At least two full-length books on Stanley Kubrick are devoted to frame-by-frame analysis of his visual style: <i>Stanley Kubrick, Director: A Visual Analysis</i> by Alexander Walker, and <i>Stanley Kubrick: Visual Poet 1928â€“1999 (Basic Film)</i> by Paul Duncan. History professor Geoffrey Cocks notes that Kubrick has what he calls an "open narrative" style that "requires the audience to derive meaning actively rather than being passively instructed, entertained, and manipulated." On the other hand, Cocks believes that Kubrick's preoccupation with sweeping overarching historical themes causes him to frequently sacrifice character development. "His films consistently display a basic taxonomy of violence, systems of control, and inherent human evil. This idÃ©e fixe freezes the people in his films into types rather than fully developed characters."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick has been noted both for his social commentary and for his distinctive visual style. Regarding social commentary, Kubrick has been noted for the recurring theme of concern with the over-mechanization of society which, in its attempt to create a safe environment, creates an artificial sterility that breeds the very evils it tries to exclude. Multiple critics have noted that Kubrick's earlier films have more straightforward linear narrative while the later films are moderately and subtly surreal reflecting a sense of social dislocation and confusion The emotional distance Kubrick maintains from many of his characters have caused critics to see Kubrick as a cold and detached rationalist, while the recurrence of strongly psychopathic characters from Alex DeLarge to Jack Torrance in his films have caused many to view Kubrick's outlook as deeply pessimistic. A frequently recurring observation on the Kubrick film that Steven Spielberg completed <i>A.I</i> is that it uneasily meshes Spielberg's rosy optimistic outlook with Kubrick's pessimistic one, although one reviewer wrote â€œSpielberg, has done a remarkable job in balancing Kubrick's pessimism with his optimism without having one overcrowd the otherâ€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In spite of Kubrick's own denial that he is a pessimist, the charge is frequently repeated. Newspaper obituaries of Kubrick notably the one in <i>The New York Times</i> by Stephen Holden (as well as that in the <i>San Jose Mercury</i>), the entry on Kubrick in the online edition of <i>EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica</i>, and Vincent LoBrutto's full-length biography of Kubrick (which was spoken of approvingly by Kubrick's wife) all characterize Kubrick broadly as pessimistic. (Holden wrote â€œif Mr. Kubrick's misanthropy prompted some critics to accuse him of coldness and inhumanity, others saw his pessimism as an uncompromisingly Swiftian vision of human absurdity.â€&#157;) So also did Kubrick's most severe critic, Pauline Kael. The charge was repeated in reviews of the multi-film DVD boxed set of his films in 2007, a New Jersey film critic writing â€œAnd yet preserved too -- like an ugly insect trapped in amber -- are some of the artist's most problematic qualities, including a bitter pessimism, a cruel humor and an almost godlike superiority that often viewed other people -- and particularly women -- as little more than impediments." A pessimistic streak was found in essays collected in <i>The Philosophy of Stanley Kubrick</i>, one of which characterizes <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> as â€œa kind of Sartrean pessimism about our inevitable dissatisfaction with romantic love.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not all critics agree with this assessment. Other essays in the same anthology find <i>Eyes</i> to be very optimistic. James Naremore in <i>On Kubrick</i> characterizes Kubrick as a modernist in the tradition of James Joyce and Franz Kafka with their distrust of mass society. As such, Naremore notes that Kubrick's detachment from his subjects does not make him a dour pessimist, although Kubrick does often dwell on â€œthe failure of scientific reasoning, and the fascistic impulses in masculine sexualityâ€&#157;. Peter Kramer's study of <i>2001</i> argues it is meant to counterweight the pessimism of Kubrick's previous <i>Doctor Strangelove</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some view Kubrick's pessimism as either at least overstated by others or even more apparent than real, an impression created by Kubrick's refusal of any bland or cheap optimism, refusal to make films that conform to conventional ideas of a spectacle, and a desire to employ films as a wake-up call to humanity to understand its capacity for evil. The editors of <i>The Kubrick Site</i> note that Kubrick avoids cinematically conventional ways of structuring stories. This does indeed create for many viewers a sense of emotionless detachment from the human subjects as noted above. For example, Kubrick often prefers lengthy dialogue scenes shot from one camera angle with no cutting. But the editors of TKS believe this is done in order to establish a life of characters beyond dialogue which "helps to reveal, in the spaces and silences, some of the emotional nature permeating the film's world" as well as a realistic sense of the characters' situatedness in time and society. Kubrick's focus is not just on individual characters but on the larger society around them and how it affects their motivation, often in negative ways. The authors also stress that however bleak Kubrick's outlook (intermittently) is, he is not a misanthrope.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A recent outspoken dissenter from pessimistic readings of Kubrick is author Julian Rice, a scholar of Native American literature. His book <i>Kubrick's Hope</i> argues that although there is a powerful vision of evil in Kubrick, there is vision of redemption and goodness in Kubrick's films stronger than often initially recognized, a vision focused both on family feeling and access to the sublime depths of the subconscious beyond superficial socialization. However, Rice has been alleged to misrepresent the work of prior Kubrick film scholars, particularly with reference to just how pessimistic or misanthropic they actually think Kubrick's films are.</p>

They subsequently get in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl" title="Brawl">brawl</a> with their rivals. Upon hearing the sounds of police sirens, Alex and his gang flee, stealing a car and driving into the countryside. They then gain entry to the home of Mr. Alexander (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Magee_(actor)" title="Patrick Magee (actor)">Patrick Magee</a>), a writer, under <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_pretenses" title="False pretenses">false pretenses</a> and assault him while violently raping his wife (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Corri" title="Adrienne Corri">Adrienne Corri</a>), all while Alex sings <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_(song)" title="Singin' in the Rain (song)">Singin' in the Rain</a></i>. When they return to the milk bar, Alex strikes Dim on his thighs with his cane when he interrupts a female patron who is singing the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Joy" title="Ode to Joy">Ode to Joy</a> from the final movement of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_No._9_(Beethoven)" title="Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)">Ninth Symphony</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven" title="Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, a composer Alex admires.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next day, Alex skips school and has an encounter with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probation_officer" title="Probation officer">probation officer</a> Mr. P. R. Deltoid (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_Morris" title="Aubrey Morris">Aubrey Morris</a>). Deltoid is exasperated with Alex and talks about all his hard work with him. Deltoid is the one person who easily sees through Alex's lies. After picking up and having sex with two girls from a record shop, Alex regroups with his droogs in his building lobby, but finds Georgie insisting the gang be run in a "new way" that entails less power for Alex and more ambitious crimes. As they walk along a canal, Alex attacks his droogs in order to re-establish his leadership.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">That night, the gang attempts to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion" title="Home invasion">invade</a> the home of a woman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Karlin" title="Miriam Karlin">Miriam Karlin</a>) who lives alone with her cats and runs a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_farm" title="Health farm">health farm</a>. In the process, she gets into a fight with Alex, and Alex bludgeons her with a phallus-shaped statue. Dim smashes a milk bottle across Alex's face, temporarily blinding him and leaving him to be found by the police as Dim, Georgie, and Pete flee the scene. During his interrogation, Alex is told by Mr. Deltoid that he is now a murderer, because the woman died from her injuries.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alex is tried for murder, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conviction" title="Conviction">convicted</a>, and sentenced to 14 years in prison. Two years into his sentence, Alex becomes friends with the prison <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain" title="Chaplain">chaplain</a> and takes a keen interest in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible" title="Bible">Bible</a>, primarily the more violent passages. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_minister" title="Interior minister">Minister of the Interior</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Sharp" title="Anthony Sharp">Anthony Sharp</a>) arrives at the prison looking for volunteers for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_technique" title="Ludovico technique">Ludovico technique</a>, an experimental <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aversion_therapy" title="Aversion therapy">aversion therapy</a> for rehabilitating criminals. Alex eagerly steps forward, wanting only to get out of prison, and not caring at all about the technique, much to the disgust of Chief Officer Barnes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bates_(actor)" title="Michael Bates (actor)">Michael Bates</a>). At the Ludovico facility, Alex is placed in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straitjacket" title="Straitjacket">straitjacket</a> and forced to watch films containing scenes of extreme violence while being given drugs to induce reactions of revulsion. The films presented includes real scenes in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a> as Beethoven's Ninth Symphony plays over it. Alex realises this will probably condition him against Beethoven's music and makes an agonised though unsuccessful attempt to have the treatment end prematurely before the conditioning sets in. Two weeks later, after the treatment is finished, Alex's reformed behaviour is demonstrated for the audience. He is unable to respond to an Irish actor's (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Clive" title="John Clive">John Clive</a>) shouting insults and picking a fight with him, and a feeling of sickness attacks him when he is presented with a young topless woman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Wetherell" title="Virginia Wetherell">Virginia Wetherell</a>) who sexually arouses him. The Minister declares Alex to be cured, but the chaplain asserts that Alex no longer has any free will.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alex is immediately released from prison. He returns home only to find that his possessions have been confiscated by the state and his parents have rented his room to a lodger named Joe (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Francis" title="Clive Francis">Clive Francis</a>), leaving him on his own. On the street, Alex comes across the same vagrant he had assaulted before the treatment, who shouts for his friends and they attack Alex. Two policemen arrive to break up the fight, but Alex discovers the policemen to be his former droogs, Georgie and Dim. They drag Alex out to the countryside, where they brutally beat and half-drown him in a cattle water trough.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Battered and bruised, Alex wanders to the home of Mr. Alexander, who does not recognise him from two years previously, due to the mask Alex had worn at the time. Permanently crippled from that attack, which also severely injured his wife and resulted in her death during a subsequent flu outbreak, Mr. Alexander now lives with a personal bodyguard, manservant, and physical trainer named Julian (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Prowse" title="David Prowse">David Prowse</a>). Mr. Alexander, who reveals himself to be a political subversive, takes Alex into his home, aware that he had undergone the Ludovico treatment due to the story published in all of the country's newspapers. Mr. Alexander tends to Alex's wounds and calls in two colleagues (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Savident" title="John Savident">John Savident</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Tyzack" title="Margaret Tyzack">Margaret Tyzack</a>), intending to use Alex as a weapon against the government, but the memories of his assault return when Alex sings "Singin' in the Rain" while he is taking a bath. After Mr. Alexander and his colleagues take a statement from Alex they drug him, lock him in the upper floor of the house and play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beethoven%27s_Ninth_Symphony" title="Beethoven's Ninth Symphony">Beethoven's Ninth Symphony</a> at full volume through a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_fidelity" title="High fidelity">powerful stereo</a> on the floor below, knowing that the Ludovico treatment will cause immense pain to Alex. In order to escape the torture, Alex becomes suicidal and throws himself out of the room's window.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alex recovers consciousness days later to find himself in traction, with dreams about doctors messing around inside his head. Through a series of psychological tests, Alex finds that he no longer has a revulsion to violence. The Minister of the Interior comes to Alex and apologises for subjecting him to the treatment, and informs him that Mr. Alexander has been "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_disappearance" title="Forced disappearance">put away</a>". The Minister then offers Alex an important government job and, as a show of goodwill, has a stereo wheeled to his bedside playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then realises that instead of an adverse reaction to the music, he sees images of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal" title="Sexual arousal">sexual pleasure</a>. He then states, in a sarcastic and menacing voice-over, "I was cured, all right!"</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The filmâ€™s central <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_philosophy" title="Moral philosophy">moral question</a> (as in many of Burgessâ€™ books), is the definition of â€œ<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodness_and_value_theory" title="Goodness and value theory">Goodness</a>â€&#157;, and whether it makes sense to use aversion theory to stop immoral behavior. Stanley Kubrick writing in <i>Saturday Review</i> described the film as</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, but not by choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange â€” organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. In the prison, after witnessing the Technique in action on Alex, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplain" title="Chaplain">chaplain</a> criticises it as false, arguing that true goodness <i>must</i> come from within. This leads to the theme of abusing liberties â€” personal, governmental, civil â€” by Alex, with two conflicting political forces, the Government and the Dissidents, both manipulating Alex for their purely political ends. The story critically portrays the â€œconservativeâ€&#157; and â€œliberalâ€&#157; parties as equal, for using Alex as a means to their political ends: the writer Frank Alexander â€” a victim of Alex and gang â€” wants revenge against Alex <i>and</i> sees him as a means of definitively turning the populace against the incumbent government and its new rÃ©gime. Mr Alexander fears the new government; in telephonic conversation, he says:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It has been noted that Alex's immorality is reflected in the society in which he lives. The Cat Lady's love of hardcore pornographic art is comparable to Alex's taste for sex and violence. Lighter forms of pornographic content adorn Alex's parents' home and in a later scene Alex awakens in hospital from his coma, interrupting a nurse and doctor engaged in a sexual act.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another critical target is the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviourism" title="Behaviourism">behaviourism</a> (or "behavioural psychology") of the 1940s to 1960s as propounded by the psychologists <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson" title="John B. Watson">John B. Watson</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner" title="B. F. Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling prominent behaviourist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner" title="B. F. Skinner">B. F. Skinner</a>â€™s most popular book, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Freedom_and_Dignity" title="Beyond Freedom and Dignity">Beyond Freedom and Dignity</a></i> (1971), â€œone of the most dangerous books ever writtenâ€&#157;. Although behaviourism's limitiations were conceded by its principal founder, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_B._Watson" title="John B. Watson">J. B. Watson</a>, Skinner argued that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviour_modification" title="Behaviour modification">behaviour modification</a>Â â€“ specifically, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning" title="Operant conditioning">operant conditioning</a> (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" title="Classical conditioning">"classical" Watsonian conditioning</a>Â â€“ is the key to an ideal society. The film's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_technique" title="Ludovico technique">Ludovico technique</a> is widely perceived, however, as a parody of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aversion_therapy" title="Aversion therapy">aversion therapy</a> more than of classical or operant conditioning.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In showing the "rehabilitated" Alex repelled by both sex and violence, the film suggests that in depriving him of his ability to fend for himself, Alex's moral conditioning via the Ludovico technique <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehumanization" title="Dehumanization">dehumanises</a> him, just as Alex's acts of violence in the first part of the film dehumanise his victims. The technique's attempt to condition Alex to associate violence with severe physical sickness is akin to the CIAâ€™s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKULTRA" title="Project MKULTRA">Project MKULTRA</a> of the 1950s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ludovico technique has been compared to the existing technique of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_castration" title="Chemical castration">chemical castration</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the filming of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludovico_technique" title="Ludovico technique">Ludovico Technique</a> scene, McDowell scratched a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornea" title="Cornea">cornea</a> and was temporarily blinded. The doctor standing next to him in the scene, dropping <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saline_(medicine)" title="Saline (medicine)">saline solution</a> into Alexâ€™s forced-open eyes, was a real physician present to prevent the actorâ€™s eyes from drying. McDowell also cracked some ribs filming the humiliation stage show. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effects" title="Special effects">Special effects</a>-wise, when Alex jumps out the window in an attempt to commit suicide, the viewer sees the ground approaching the camera until collision, i.e. as if from Alex's point of view. This effect was achieved by dropping a Newman Sinclair clockwork camera in a box, lens-first, from the third storey of the Corus Hotel. To Kubrick's surprise, the camera survived six takes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cinematic adaptation of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1962), by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Burgess" title="Anthony Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a>, was accidental. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">Screenplay writer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Southern" title="Terry Southern">Terry Southern</a> gave Kubrick a copy of the novel, but, as he was developing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>-related project, Kubrick put it aside. Soon afterward, however, the Bonaparte project was canceled and, sometime later, Kubrick happened upon the novel. It had an immediate impact. Of his enthusiasm for it, Kubrick said, â€œI was excited by everything about it, the plot, the ideas, the characters and of course the languageÂ ... The story functions, of course, on several levels, political, sociological, philosophical and, whatâ€™s most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic levelâ€&#157;. Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying â€œI think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenesâ€&#157;.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Anthony Burgess had mixed feelings about the cinema version of his novel, publicly saying he loved <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_McDowell" title="Malcolm McDowell">Malcolm McDowell</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bates_(actor)" title="Michael Bates (actor)">Michael Bates</a>, and the use of music; he praised it as â€œbrilliantâ€&#157;, even so brilliant that it might be dangerous. Despite this enthusiasm, he was concerned that it lacked the novel's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange#Omission_of_the_final_chapter" title="A Clockwork Orange">redemptive final chapter</a>, an absence he blamed upon his American publisher (this chapter being omitted in all US editions of the novel prior to 1986) and not Kubrick.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burgess reports in his autobiography <i>Youâ€™ve Had Your Time</i>Â (1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's 1974 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Symphony" title="Napoleon Symphony">Napoleon Symphony</a></i> was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured, however, when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsed_Catholic" title="Lapsed Catholic">(lapsed) Catholic</a>, Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organizations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascist</a> dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Burgess was deeply hurt, feeling that Kubrick had used him as a film publicity pawn. Malcolm McDowell, on publicity tour with Burgess, shared his feelings, and, at times, spoke harshly about Kubrick. As evidence, both novelist and actor cited Kubrickâ€™s uncontrolled ego manifest in the film credits: the only author credited is "Kubrick". Later, Burgess spoofed Kubrickâ€™s image, firstly in the musical version of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, where a Kubrick-like character is beaten; then in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clockwork_Testament,_or_Enderby%27s_End" title="The Clockwork Testament, or Enderby's End">The Clockwork Testament</a></i>Â (1974) novel, where the poet F.X. Enderby is attacked for â€œglorifyingâ€&#157; violence in a film adaptation; and, in 1980, as the crafty director Sidney Labrick in the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthly_Powers" title="Earthly Powers">Earthly Powers</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first dramatization of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, featuring only the storyâ€™s first three chapters, was made for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> programme <i>Tonight</i>, broadcast soon after the novel's original publication in 1962; no recording is known to exist. Six years before Stanley Kubrickâ€™s film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol" title="Andy Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_(1965_film)" title="Vinyl (1965 film)">Vinyl</a></i>, a low-budget version of the work. Reportedly, only two scenes are recognizable: â€œVictorâ€&#157; (Alex) wreaking havoc and undergoing the Ludovico treatment. However, both Kubrick's and Warhol's films start with a similar shot - camera zooming out of Alex's face.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrick was a perfectionist of meticulous research (with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations), many scene takes - however per Malcolm McDowell, he usually â€œgot it rightâ€&#157; early on, so there were few takes. Filming took place between September 1970 and April 1971, marking <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> as his quickest film shoot in the later part of his career. Technically, to achieve and convey the fantastic, dream-like quality of the story, he filmed with extreme wide-angle lenses such as the Kinoptik Tegea 9.8mm for 35mm Arriflex cameras, and used fast- and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion" title="Slow motion">slow motion</a> to convey the mechanical nature of its bedroom sex scene or stylize the violence in a manner similar to Toshio Matsumotoâ€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Funeral_Parade_of_Roses" title="Funeral Parade of Roses">Funeral Parade of Roses</a></i>(1969).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> was photographed mostly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filming_location" title="Filming location">on location</a> in metropolitan London. Little studio filming was used, except for the Korova Milk bar, the Prison Check-in sequence, and scenes of Alex at F. Alexander's house taking a bath, and in the hallway. Sets for these parts were built at an old factory on Bullhead Road, Elstree, which also served as the production office. Other scene locations in the film include:</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> was critically well-received, and nominated for several awards, including the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a> (losing to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_French_Connection_(film)" title="The French Connection (film)">The French Connection</a></i>), also re-invigorating sales of Ludwig van Beethovenâ€™s â€œNinth Symphonyâ€&#157;.

Also noting that the cinematic Alex no longer enjoyed running-over small animals or raping under-aged girls, and argued that violent scenes â€” the Billyboyâ€™s gang extended stripping of the very buxom woman they intend to rape â€” were offered for titillation; â€œStanley Strangeloveâ€&#157; is in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deeper_into_Movies" title="Deeper into Movies">Deeper into Movies</a></i> (1974) a collection of her film criticism.</p>

In 1982, the Office abolished the â€œCondemnedâ€&#157; rating; hence, films the Conference of Bishops deem to have unacceptable sex and violence are rated <i>O</i>, â€œMorally Offensiveâ€&#157;.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The British authorities considered the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence" title="Sexual violence">sexual violence</a> extreme, furthermore, there occurred legal claims that the movie <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> had inspired true <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat" title="Copycat">copycat</a> behaviour, as per press cuttings at the British Film Institute. In March 1972, at trial, the prosecutor accusing the fourteen-year-old-boy defendant of the manslaughter of a classmate, referred to <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, telling the judge that the case had a macabre relevance to the film. The attacker, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley" title="Bletchley">Bletchley</a> boy of sixteen, pleaded guilty after telling police that friends had told him of the film â€œand the beating up of an old boy like this oneâ€&#157;; defence counsel told the trial â€œthe link between this crime and sensational literature, particularly <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, is established beyond reasonable doubtâ€&#157;. The press also blamed the film for a rape in which the attackers sang â€œ<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singin%27_in_the_Rain_(song)" title="Singin' in the Rain (song)">Singin' in the Rain</a>â€&#157;. Subsequently, Kubrick asked Warner Brothers to withdraw the film from British distribution.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Popular belief was that those copycat attacks led Kubrick to withdraw the film from distribution in the United Kingdom. However, in the film documentary <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Film</i>, made after his death, widow Christiane confirmed rumours that he withdrew <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> on police advice, after threats against him and family (the source of those threats are undiscussed). That Warner Bros. acceded to his withdrawal request indicates the good business relations the director had with the studio, especially the executive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Semel" title="Terry Semel">Terry Semel</a>. The ban was vigorously pursued in Kubrickâ€™s lifetime. One art house cinema that defied the ban in 1993, and was sued and lost, is the Scala cinema at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Cross,_London" title="Kings Cross, London">Kings Cross, London</a>; the same premises of present-day <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(club)" title="Scala (club)">Scala</a> nightclub. Unable to meet the cost of the defence, the cinema club was forced into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_receivership" title="Administrative receivership">receivership</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Whatever the reason for the film's withdrawal, for some 27 years, it was difficult to see the film in the United Kingdom. It reappeared in cinemas, and the first VHS and DVD releases followed soon after Kubrickâ€™s death. On 4 July 2001, the uncut <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, had its premiere broadcast on Sky TVâ€™s <i>Sky Box Office</i>; the run was until mid-September.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1993, Channel 4 broadcast <i>Forbidden Fruit</i>, a 27-minute documentary about the controversial withdrawal of the film in Britain. It contains much footage from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, thus, marking the only time portions of the film were shown to British audiences during the twenty-seven year ban. Kubrick failed to stop the <i>Forbidden Fruit</i> documentaryâ€™s use of said footage.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> was neither marketed as a horror film, nor reviewed as one upon release. Over a period of time, it has gained a following among horror film aficionados, frequently discussed as one in online bulletin boards and chat rooms devoted to horror films (with some dissenters as to the classification), as well as being listed in an online horror film database. The UK daily paper Metro had a reader poll of favorite horror films in 2010 and reported that <i>The Exorcist</i> beat out <i>Saw</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One well-known critic who counts the film as horror is Maitland McDonagh, senior movies editor of TVGuide from 1995 to 2008, and author of a book on the horror films of Dario Argento. Commenting on why horror films rarely win Oscars, she notes the exceptions of <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> saying the prestige of the directors meant the films could not be ignored.  English novelist Julian Mitchell described the novel as a remarkable mixture of horror and farce.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the other hand, American Movie Channel's film critic Cory Abbey in an article on scary movies that are <i>not</i> horror lists <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>  along with <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> and others. When the American Film Institute chose their top 10 films in several genres, it listed <i>Clockwork</i> as a science-fiction film, while having no horror list at all.. The film is listed as crime drama and science-fiction by the Internet Movie Database but not as horror.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> is most frequently described as political satire, dystopian science-fiction, black comedy, and crime drama, although its crossover appeal to the horror fan community is unmistakable.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel">Differences between the film and the novel</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kubrickâ€™s film is relatively faithful to the Burgess novel, omitting only the final, positive chapter, wherein, Alex matures and outgrows <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy#Sociopathy" title="Psychopathy">sociopathy</a>. Whereas the film ends with Alex offered an open-ended government job â€” implying he remains a sociopath at heart â€” the novel ends with Alexâ€™s positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay upon the novel's American edition, its final chapter deleted on insistence of the American publisher. He claimed not having read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.</p>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>The film includes the phrase "A Clockwork Orange" only once. We see A Clockwork Orange written on a piece of paper in Mr. Alexander's typewriter. The book explains that the author Frank is supposed to have written a political tract by that name (with a passage explaining the title), but this is not mentioned in the movie.</li>
	<li>As noted above, the last chapter (21) of the novel was not filmed. In this chapter, Alex encounters Pete, the third member of the original gang (who was heavily cut out of the film) who has grown beyond his violent ways and married; Alex realises that he wishes to do the same, but believes his violence was an unavoidable product of his youth. See also "Deleted Scenes" section below.</li>
	<li>In the novel, the writer whose wife Alex rapes is named "F. Alexander", leading to a coincidental comparison between the two "Alexanders". The film does not mention his surname, though he is called "Mr. Alexander" in the credits. In the film, he is addressed by his first name, "Frank", a detail not revealed in the book. The writer is quite young in the novel, and elderly in the film. The novel is also very overt quite early about his being a political activist. This is strongly hinted at in the film by scattered clues, but not spelled out so clearly.</li>
	<li>In the film, Alex's surname is spoken as "DeLarge" on arrival at prison; this surname is a pun based on an incident in the book, when Alex (referring to his penis) calls himself "Alexander the Large" (in turn a reference to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great" title="Alexander the Great">Alexander the Great</a>). In a close-up shot of multiple newspaper articles, Alex is identified as "Alex Burgess". In the novel, Alex's surname is unknown.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>Alex's character in the film is more subtly manipulative, as illustrated in a few examples. In the novel, the incarcerated Alex and cell mates brutally beat a man just put in their cell, for being a nuisance. Alex accidentally kills him. For such persistent violence, Alex is selected to undergo the Ludovico Technique. However, in the film, Alex volunteers for the treatment and is chosen in part for his good behaviour in prison.<br/>
Similarly, when Alex's parents visit him in the hospital, Alex threatens them with violence in the novel while in the film, he more subtly plays on their feelings of grief and guilt. Alex's behavior to the prison chaplain is similarly manipulative.</li>
	<li>Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a considerable shambles and in a state of desperation while the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's broad preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<br/>
One example of this would be subtle differences in the portrayal of P.R. Deltoid, Alex's "post-corrective advisor". In the novel, P.R. Deltoid appears to have some moral authority (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime despite his protestations). In the film, Deltoid is a somewhat comical figure who inadvertently drinks from a glass holding dentures and, after delivering a morality lecture to Alex, punches the boy in his crotch.</li>
	<li>The film also suggestes that the experimentation of Alex using the Ludovico's Treatment is far more politically motivated, and that the controlling party is attempting to implement the Ludovico's Treatment as a way to gain votes. The subsequent "curing" and bribing of Alex is used to cover-up for the Party's PR struggles and to portray Mr. Alexander and the Left-wing as monstrous.</li>
	<li>In the film, the "cat lady" whose house Alex breaks into possesses a great deal of sexual artwork, including a rocking penis sculpture with which Alex delivers the (inadvertent) killing strike. None of this artwork is mentioned in the book. The "cat lady" in the novel is elderly, addled, and living in a cat-ridden house of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Havisham" title="Miss Havisham">Miss Havisham</a>-style dilapidation; the "cat lady" in the movie is in her early 60s, sharp, and living in a health farm which (according to dialogue) has closed for a week.</li>
	<li>In the novel, it is completely clear that Mrs. Alexander died of injuries sustained during the gang-rape. Kubrick's film has Mr. Alexander rant that his wife died a few months later during a flu epidemic, though he still blames her death on the rape. He calls her a "victim of the modern age".</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>While Alex is being tortured by Mr. Alexander's playing of Beethoven on the stereo, Kubrick composes the shot so that the author is transformed into a bust of Beethoven. Even the arrangement of the scarf around his neck suggests the contours of a statuette.</li>
	<li>In the film, when the Cat Lady assaults Alex, she holds a small bust of Beethoven, while Alex holds a large sculpted penis. In the novel, Alex wields a bust of Beethoven during their fight, while the Cat Lady attempts to fight back with a walking stick. Additionally, in the novel, Alex is attacked by the Cat Lady's cats as he tries to escape.</li>
	<li>Alex is conditioned against all music in the book, but in the film he is only averse to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. During one of the applications of the Ludovico Technique, Beethoven's Fifth symphony is played, and Alex begs for them to stop. In the movie, it is the Ninth symphony which is played during this scene.</li>
	<li>Conversely, while Alex appears to be conditioned only against rape by the Ludovico Technique in the book, he appears to be conditioned against all sexuality in the film.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>Two of the attacks in the opening chapters of the novelâ€”the assault on a library patron carrying rare books, and the strong-arm robbery of a shopkeeper and his wifeâ€”are not present in the film. On his commentary on the 2007 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> release, Malcolm McDowell says the scenes were filmed but later discarded. Billy Russell, the actor playing the library patron, became ill after the initial production and was not available for the scenes in which Alex re-encounters his old victims.</li>
	<li>In the novel, Alex and his gang buy drinks and snacks for a group of old ladies, bribing them into providing the police with an alibi to cover a crast (shop burglary). None of this appears in the film; the scene with the old ladies was shot, but not used.</li>
	<li>In the novel, Alex is beaten by prison guards. The film does not show this, but Alex mentions it in his narration.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>In the novel, F. Alexander lives alone after the death of his wife, and manages most of the housework by himself despite his condition. In the film, he is shown to have hired a bodyguard named Julian to help him around the house and guard the home from future break-ins. The bodyguard is played by former bodybuilder and future <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Prowse" title="David Prowse">David Prowse</a> in a brief role.</li>
	<li>In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel. This was added by Kubrick due to Malcolm McDowell's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophidiophobia" title="Ophidiophobia">fear of snakes</a>.</li>

	<li>The girl that is about to be raped by Billyboy's gang is 10 in the book, but a young woman, around 16-17, in the film.</li>
	<li>In the novel, Alex takes home and rapes two 10-year-old girls, Marty and Sonietta, after meeting them in a record shop. In the film, the girls are teenagers, and their sexual encounter with Alex appears to be (at least mostly) consensual. Also, in the book, Alex buys the girls ice cream and food prior to raping them, while this scene is not included in the film (though, in the film, the girls are shown slurping on popsicles at the record shop).</li>

	<li>In the novel, Dr. Branom is a male. In the film, the character is female.</li>
	<li>The film uses the futuristic slang language <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadsat" title="Nadsat">Nadsat</a> somewhat less often than the book in order to make the film more accessible.</li>

	<li>In the film, Alex and his droogs beat a tramp, who later recognizes him and, with other homeless people, assaults him after his treatment. In the book, Alex beats an old man carrying library books, who later recognizes him and (with other aged people) assaults him in a library after his treatment. Alex and his droogs also beat a tramp in the book, but Alex does not encounter him again.</li>
	<li>Alex's weapon of choice in the book is a britva (razor); in the film, he wields a cane with a knife concealed in the handle (similar to a Victorian London dagger cane).</li>
	<li>In the film, the car seen before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_invasion" title="Home invasion">home invasion</a> is the M-505 Adams Brothers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probe_16" title="Probe 16">Probe 16</a>, in the novel (and in the film's narration) however, it is referred to as Durango 95.

	<li>When trying to escape from the cat lady's house, Alex is stopped by Dim, who attacks him and leaves him for the police. In the novel, Dim uses his "oozy" (or chain) to whip Alex across the face. In the film, Dim smashes a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_bottle" title="Milk bottle">milk bottle</a> across the side of Alex's head.</li>
	<li>In the novel, Alex's prisoner number is 6655321; in the film, it is 655321.</li>
	<li>In the novel, an imprisoned Alex learns of the death of his former droog Georgie during a botched burglary. In the film, Alex meets with Dim and Georgie after his release from prison, but what happened to Pete during Alex's incarceration is unknown.</li>
	<li>In the novel, Alex is beaten by his former droog, Dim, and his former rival, Billyboy, who have both joined the police. The beating itself is not described, though Alex subsequently notes soreness and several teeth knocked loose (he also believes himself to be covered with cuts and bruises). In the film, Billyboy is replaced in this scene by Georgie, another former droog; they take Alex down a wood path to a watering trough, where Dim forces Alex's head underwater, and Georgie beats him with his truncheon.</li>
	<li>In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through a number of careless references to the previous attack (e.g., his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he hauntingly had done whilst attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too "stiff".</li>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The music is a thematic extension of Alexâ€™s (and the viewerâ€™s) psychological conditioning. The soundtrack of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> comprises <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_classical_music" title="European classical music">classical music</a> and electronic synthetic music composed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Carlos" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a> (who, having not yet undergone <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_reassignment_surgery" title="Sex reassignment surgery">sex reassignment surgery</a>, was credited as "Walter Carlos"). Some of the music is heard only as excerpts, e.g. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Elgar" title="Edward Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>â€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomp_and_Circumstance_March_No._1" title="Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1">Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1</a></i> (<i>aka</i> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_of_Hope_and_Glory" title="Land of Hope and Glory">Land of Hope and Glory</a></i>) ironically heralding a politicianâ€™s appearance at the prison. The main theme is an electronic transcription of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Purcell" title="Henry Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>â€™s <i>Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary</i>, composed in 1695, for the procession of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_II_of_England" title="Mary II of England">Queen Mary</a>â€™s cortÃ¨ge through London en route to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Abbey" title="Westminster Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. â€œMarch from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>â€&#157; was the first recorded song featuring a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder" title="Vocoder">vocoder</a> for the singing; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthpop" title="Synthpop">synthpop</a> bands often cite it as their inspiration. Neither the end-credits, nor the soundtrack album, name the orchestra playing the Ninth Symphony excerpts, however, in Alexâ€™s bedroom, there is a close-up of a microcassette tape labeled: <i>Deutsche Grammophon â€“ Ludwig van Beethoven â€“ Symphonie Nr. 9 d-moll, op. 125 â€“ Berliner Philharmoniker â€“ Chor der St. Hedwigskathedrale â€“ Ferenc Fricsay â€“ Irmgard Seefried, Maureen Forrester, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Ernst Haefliger</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the novel, Alex is conditioned against all classical music, but in the film, only against L.V. Beethovenâ€™s <i>Ninth Symphony</i>, the soundtrack of a violent Ludovico Technique film. The audience do not see every violent film Alex is forced to view during Ludovico conditioning, yet the symphonyâ€™s fourth movement is heard. Later, using the symphonyâ€™s second movement, Mr Alexander, and fellow plotters, impel Alex to suicide.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although two excerpts from Rimsky-Korsakov's <i>Scheherazade</i> are heard during Alex's Biblical daydreams while reading the Bible in jail, this piece does not appear on the soundtrack album, nor is it listed in the closing credits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, its presence in the film is acknowledged by critic Michel Ciment in the filmography in the back of his book <i>Kubrick</i>, and at least the composer's name is mentioned as used in the soundtrack in other 3 other books on either Kubrick or the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the book Kristopher Spencer's book on film scores both Rimsky-Korsakov's <i>Scheherazade</i> and Terry Tucker's <i>Overture to the Sun</i> were used by Kubrick originally as temp tracks for the film, but he ultimately chose to stick to these rather than the pieces Wendy Carlos composed for those sections. He states the original LP omitted the first due to lack of space on a traditional vinyl LP recording.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three months after the official soundtrack's release, composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Carlos" title="Wendy Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a> released <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Carlos%27_Clockwork_Orange" title="Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange">Walter Carlos' Clockwork Orange</a></i> (1972) (Columbia KC 31480), a second version of the soundtrack containing unused cues and musical elements unheard in the film. For example, Kubrick used only part of â€œTimestepsâ€&#157;, and a short version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesiser" title="Synthesiser">synthesiser</a> transcription of the Ninth Symphonyâ€™s Scherzo. The second soundtrack album contains a synthesiser version of Rossini's â€œLa Gazza Ladraâ€&#157; (The Thieving Magpie); the film contains an orchestral version. In 1998, a digitally-remastered album edition, with tracks of the synthesiser music was released. It contains Carlosâ€™s compositions, including those unused in the film, and the â€œBiblical Daydreamsâ€&#157; and â€œOrange Minuetâ€&#157; cues excluded from the 1972 edition.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carlos composed the first three minutes of â€œTimestepsâ€&#157; before reading the novel <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. Originally intending it as the introduction to a vocoder rendition of the Ninth Symphonyâ€™s Choral movement; it was completed approximately when Kubrick completed the photography; â€œTimestepsâ€&#157; and the vocoder Ninth Symphony were the foundation for the Carlosâ€“Kubrick collaboration.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moreover, Stanley Kubrick asked <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd" title="Pink Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> bassist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Waters" title="Roger Waters">Roger Waters</a> to use elements of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_Heart_Mother_(suite)" title="Atom Heart Mother (suite)">Atom Heart Mother</a></i> suite. Waters refused when he found that Kubrick wanted the freedom to cut up the piece to fit the film. Later, Waters asked Kubrick if he could use sounds from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)" title="2001: A Space Odyssey (film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></i>; Kubrick refused.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wendy Carlos reused many of the musical motifs from this score (including the main themes by Purcell, Rossini, and Beethoven) in <i>Clockwork Black</i>, the 4th movement of her (1998) musical composition <i>Tales of Heaven and Hell</i>.</p>
