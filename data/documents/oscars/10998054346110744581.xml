	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rathbone was once arrested in the 1920s along with every other member of the cast of <i>The Captive</i>, a play in which his character's wife left him for another woman.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He commenced his film career in 1925 in <i>The Masked Bride</i>, appeared in a few <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent movies</a>, and played the detective <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo_Vance" title="Philo Vance">Philo Vance</a> in the 1930 movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bishop_Murder_Case" title="The Bishop Murder Case">The Bishop Murder Case</a></i>, based on the best-selling novel.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was admired for his athletic cinema swordsmanship (he listed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing" title="Fencing">fencing</a> among his favourite recreations).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Hollywood legend, Rathbone was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mitchell" title="Margaret Mitchell">Margaret Mitchell</a>'s first choice to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> in the film version of her novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind" title="Gone with the Wind">Gone with the Wind</a></i>.

Attempting to limit his typecasting as Holmes, Rathbone ceded his radio part to Tom Conway in 1946. Bruce dropped out of the radio series a few years later.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rathbone also brought Holmes to the stage in a play written by his wife Ouida. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Gomez" title="Thomas Gomez">Thomas Gomez</a>, who had appeared as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> ringleader in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes_and_the_Voice_of_Terror" title="Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror">Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror</a></i>, played the villainous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_Moriarty" title="Professor Moriarty">Professor Moriarty</a>. Nigel Bruce was too ill to take the part of Dr. Watson, and it was played by Jack Raine. Bruce's absence depressed Rathbone, particularly after Bruce died on 8 October 1953, while the play was in rehearsals. The play ran for only three performances.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1950s, Rathbone excelled in two spoofs of his earlier swashbuckling villains: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casanova%27s_Big_Night" title="Casanova's Big Night">Casanova's Big Night</a></i> (1954) opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Court_Jester" title="The Court Jester">The Court Jester</a></i> (1956) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kaye" title="Danny Kaye">Danny Kaye</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through the 1950s and 1960s, he continued to appear in several dignified anthology programs on television.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1960s, he also toured with a one-man show titled (like his autobiography) <i>In and Out of Character</i>. In this show, he recited poetry and Shakespeare as well as giving reminiscences from his life and career (e.g., the humorous, "I could have killed Errol Flynn any time I wanted to!"). As an encore, he recited Vincent Starrett's famous poem "221B."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vincent Price and Rathbone appeared together, along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Karloff" title="Boris Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London_(1939_film)" title="Tower of London (1939 film)">Tower of London</a></i> (1939) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comedy_of_Terrors" title="The Comedy of Terrors">The Comedy of Terrors</a></i> (1964).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rathbone married actress Ethel Marion Foreman in 1914.

The couple <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorced</a> in 1926.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During Rathbone's Hollywood career, his second wife Ouida BergÃ¨reâ€”who was also his business managerâ€”developed a reputation for hosting elaborate expensive parties in their home, with many prominent and influential people on the guest lists. This trend inspired a joke in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_Breakers" title="The Ghost Breakers">The Ghost Breakers</a></i> (1940), a movie in which Rathbone does not appear: During a tremendous thunderstorm in New York City, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hope" title="Bob Hope">Bob Hope</a> observes that "Basil Rathbone must be throwing a party."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The actress Mrs. Patrick Campbell described Rathbone as "two profiles pasted together".</p>
