	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Albert Bassermann</b> (born 7 September 1867, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mannheim" title="Mannheim">Mannheim</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a>; died 15 May 1952, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich" title="Zurich">Zurich</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>) was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> stage and screen actor.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bassermann was among the first German theatre actors who worked in film. In 1913, he played the main role of the lawyer in Max Mack's <i>Der Andere</i> (<i>The Other</i>), after the play by Paul Lindau. He also worked with German silent film directors Richard Oswald, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Lubitsch" title="Ernst Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a>, Leopold Jessner and Lupu Pick.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1933, Bassermann, threatened by the ascent of Nazism (he was Jewish)* left Germany and lived in the United States from 1938. Although his ability to speak English was very limited, he learned lines phonetically with assistance from his wife and found work as a character actor. For his performance as the Dutch statesman Van Meer in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Correspondent_(film)" title="Foreign Correspondent (film)">Foreign Correspondent</a></i>, Bassermann was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> as Best Supporting Actor in 1940. He returned to Europe in 1946. His final film appearance was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(1948_film)" title="The Red Shoes (1948 film)">The Red Shoes</a></i>.</p>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>Note: The statement that he, himself, was Jewish, is probably a mistake. Annija Simsone who played opposite Bassermann in the Neue Wiener Beuhne Theater in the 1920s wrote the following in her autobiography:"During the Hitler era, Bassermann did not perform in Germany, though Adolf Hitler personally held him in high regard; Elsa was Jewish.* Bassermann was told that if he wanted to continue to perform in Germany, he would have to get divorced. He did not get divorced, but Elsa and he went to Switzerland instead." </li>
      </ul>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of him, the revered American actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uta_Hagen" title="Uta Hagen">Uta Hagen</a> had this to say in her acting textbook <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respect_for_Acting" title="Respect for Acting">Respect for Acting</a>.: "One of the finest lessons I ever learned was from the great German actor Albert Basserman. I worked with him as Hilde in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Builder" title="The Master Builder">The Master Builder</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibsen" title="Ibsen">Ibsen</a>. He was already past eighty but was as 'modern' in his conception of the role of Solness and in his techniques as anyone I've ever seen or played with. In rehearsals he felt his way with the new cast. (The role had been in his repertoire for almost forty years.) He watched us, listened to us, adjusted to us, meanwhile executing his actions with only a small part of his playing energy. At the first dress rehearsal, he started to play fully. There was such a vibrant reality to the rhythm of his speech and behavior that I was swept away by it. I kept waiting for him to come to an end with his intentions so that I could take my 'turn.' As a result, I either made a big hole in the dialogue or desperately cut in on him in order to avoid another hole. I was expecting the usual 'It's your turn; then it's my turn.' At the end of the first act I went to his dressing room and said, 'Mr. Basserman, I can't apologize enough, but I never know when you're through!' He looked at me in amazement and said, 'I'm never through! And neither should you be.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His illustrious career was acknowledged when he received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iffland-Ring" title="Iffland-Ring">Iffland-Ring</a> from the prominent actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Haase" title="Friedrich Haase">Friedrich Haase</a>. While Bassermann himself attempted to bestow the Iffland-Ring, he outlived each of the three grantees he chose. Not wanting to be mistaken a fourth time, Bassermann deferred making a choice; instead, a group of German actors made the decision.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bassermann died from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a> while on a flight from New York to Zurich. He is buried in Mannheim.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The editor of the <i>New York Globe</i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Davenport_(actor)" title="Harry Davenport (actor)">Harry Davenport</a>) is concerned about the "crisis" in Europe, the growing power of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, and the inability of celebrated foreign correspondents in getting answers about whether or not war will ensue. After searching for a good, tough crime reporter for a fresh viewpoint, he appoints Johnny Jones (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_McCrea" title="Joel McCrea">Joel McCrea</a>) as a foreign correspondent, under the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen_name" title="Pen name">pen name</a> "Huntley Haverstock".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reporter's first assignment is Stephen Fisher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marshall" title="Herbert Marshall">Herbert Marshall</a>), leader of the Universal Peace Party, at an event held by Fisher in honour of a Dutch diplomat named Van Meer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Bassermann" title="Albert Bassermann">Albert Bassermann</a>). On the way to the party, Haverstock sees Van Meer entering the car which is to take him to the party, and runs to interview him; Van Meer invites him to ride along. At the party, Haverstock meets Fisher's daughter, Carol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laraine_Day" title="Laraine Day">Laraine Day</a>). Van Meer disappears mysteriously. Later, Fisher informs the guests that Van Meer, who was supposed to be the guest of honor, will not be attending the party; instead he will be at a political conference in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the conference, Van Meer is shot in front of a large crowd by a man disguised as a photographer. Haverstock commandeers a car to follow the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination" title="Assassination">assassin</a>'s getaway car. The car he jumps into happens to have in it Carol and Scott ffolliott (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Sanders" title="George Sanders">George Sanders</a>), another reporter, who explains that the capital letter in his surname was dropped in memory of an executed ancestor. The group follows the assassin to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windmill" title="Windmill">windmill</a> in the countryside.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While Carol and ffolliott  [<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>] go for help, Haverstock searches the windmill and finds a live Van Meer â€“ the man who was killed was an impostor. The old man is drugged and unable to tell him anything. Haverstock is forced to flee when the kidnappers become aware of him. By the time the police arrive, the villains have escaped with Van Meer in an airplane.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Haverstock and Carol board a British boat to England, and while a furious storm thunders overhead, he proposes to her. In England, the two go to Carol's father's house, where Haverstock sees a man whom he recognizes as one of the men at the windmill. He informs Fisher, but Fisher ignores him, saying that he will send a bodyguard to protect him. However, the bodyguard (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Gwenn" title="Edmund Gwenn">Edmund Gwenn</a>) repeatedly tries to kill Haverstock instead. When the assassin tries to push him off the top of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Cathedral" title="Westminster Cathedral">Westminster Cathedral</a> tower, Haverstock steps aside just in time and the "bodyguard" plunges to his death instead.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the meantime, England and France have declared war on Germany. Then, while the group are on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Clipper" title="Boeing Clipper">Boeing Clipper</a> plane to America, Fisher confesses his deeds to his daughter. Despite this, Carol blames Haverstock for not really loving her and only wanting to pursue her father. He protests that he was just doing his job as a reporter. Seconds later, the plane is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean. The survivors perch on the floating wing of the downed plane. Realizing that it cannot support everyone, including his daughter, Fisher commits <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> by allowing himself to drown. Jones and ffolliott attempt to save him, but are unsuccessful. Shortly after, they are picked up by an American ship, the <i>Mohican</i>, from which they relate their whole story. Later, back in London, Jones and Carol do a radio broadcast to the US, while London is being bombed, warning them about what Germany is doing.</p>

Albert Basserman, who plays Van Meer, was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">German</a> and couldn't speak <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language" title="English language">English</a>, so he had to learn all his lines phonetically.

It took numerous writers and five years before Wanger had a script he was satisfied with, by which time Hitchcock was in the U.S. under contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O.

Later, Cooper admitted to Hitchcock that he'd made a mistake in turning down the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Working titles for the film, which began production on 18 March 1940 and initially finished on 5 June, were "Personal History" and "Imposter".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the film wrapped, Hitchcock visited his native England, and returned on 3 July to report that it was expected there that the Germans would begin bombing London at any time. To accommodate this, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a> was called in to write the epilogue of the film, the scene in the radio station, which replaced the original end-sequence in which two of the characters discussed the events of the film on a transatlantic seaplane trip. The new ending was filmed on 5 July, presciently foreshadowing the celebrated radio broadcasts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow" title="Edward R. Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the sequences in the film that continues to have a strong impact on viewers is the mid-ocean crash of the <i>Clipper</i> airplane after it is shot down by a German destroyer. In 1972, in an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cavett" title="Dick Cavett">Dick Cavett</a>, Hitchcock discussed some details of how the scene was created. Footage taken from a stunt plane diving over the ocean was rear projected on rice paper in front of the cockpit set, while behind the rice paper were two chutes connected to large water tanks. The chutes were aimed at the windshield of the cockpit, so that water would break through the rice paper at the right moment, simulating the crash of the plane into the ocean.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock's eccentric marriage proposal to his wife Alma was written for this film, for the scene when Haverstock proposes to Carol.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hitchcock frequently used visual imagery to underscore the dramatic action. When McCrea flees his hotel room and touches the letter 'E' of the neon 'HOTEL' sign, he burns himself and the letters 'E' and 'L' die, appropriately leaving the word 'HOT' and leaving the hotel's name as 'HOT EUROPE', underscoring the film's theme of war in Europe. Also, there is an unmistakable image of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in the windmill scene. Right after McCrea rescues his coat from the grinding gears, and escapes out the window, he peers back in at the spies. In the right hand corner of the scene, there is a cartoon like image of Adolf Hitler formed by a wood beam and unidentified markings: Hitchcock's subtle, almost subliminal reminder of who the bad guys really represent.</p>
