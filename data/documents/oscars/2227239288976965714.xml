However, unlike his fellow bandmates, Joe Pesci was not very successful as a solo music artist, and so he moved on to pursue his acting career.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>Goodfellas</b></i> (also styled <i><b>GoodFellas</b></i>) is a 1990 American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster_film" title="Gangster film">gangster film</a> directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. It is based on the non-fiction book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiseguy_(book)" title="Wiseguy (book)">Wiseguy</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pileggi" title="Nicholas Pileggi">Nicholas Pileggi</a>, who co-wrote the screenplay for the film with Scorsese. The film follows the rise and fall of three gangsters, spanning three decades.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese originally intended to direct <i>Goodfellas</i> before <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)" title="The Last Temptation of Christ (film)">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></i>, but when funds materialized to make <i>Last Temptation</i>, he postponed what was then known as <i>Wise Guy</i>. The title of Pileggi's book had already been used for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiseguy" title="Wiseguy">TV series</a> and for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s 1986 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_Guys_(film)" title="Wise Guys (film)">Wise Guys</a></i>, so Pileggi and Scorsese changed the name of their film to <i>Goodfellas</i>. To prepare for their roles in the film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Liotta" title="Ray Liotta">Ray Liotta</a> talked often with Pileggi, who shared with the actors research material that had been left over from writing the book. According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals where Scorsese gave the actors freedom to do whatever they wanted. The director made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines that the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script the cast worked from during principal photography.</p>

She cannot bring herself to kill him and an enraged Henry threatens Karen with the gun and says he has bigger concerns: like being murdered on the streets. Henry goes to live in the apartment with Janice. Paulie soon directs him to return to Karen after completing a job for him: he and Jimmy are sent to collect from an indebted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler" title="Gambler">gambler</a> in Florida, which they succeed at after beating him.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Goodfellas</i> is based on New York crime reporter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Pileggi" title="Nicholas Pileggi">Nicholas Pileggi</a>'s book <i>Wiseguy</i>. Martin Scorsese never intended to make another mob film until he read a review of the book which inspired him to read it while working on the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_of_Money" title="Color of Money">Color of Money</a></i> in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After he read Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: "To begin <i>Goodfellas</i> like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer. I think it's the only way you can really sense the exhilaration of the lifestyle, and to get a sense of why a lot of people are attracted to it." According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, "I've been waiting for this book my entire life." To which Pileggi replied "I've been waiting for this phone call my entire life".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese originally intended to direct the film before <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)" title="The Last Temptation of Christ (film)">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></i>, but when funds materialized to make <i>Last Temptation</i>, he decided to postpone <i>Wise Guy</i>. He was drawn to the documentary aspects of Pileggi's book. "The book <i>Wise Guys</i> gives you a sense of the day-to-day life, the tedium - how they work, how they take over certain nightclubs, and for what reasons. It shows how it's done". He saw <i>Goodfellas</i> as the third film in an unplanned trilogy of films that examined the lives of Italian-Americans "from slightly different angles". He has often described the film as "a mob home movie" that is about money because "that's what they're really in business for".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese and Pileggi collaborated on the screenplay and over the course of the 12 drafts it took to reach the ideal script, the reporter realized that "the visual styling had to be completely redoneâ€¦ So we decided to share credit". They decided which sections of the book they liked and put them together like building blocks. Scorsese persuaded Pileggi that they did not need to follow a traditional narrative structure. The director wanted to take the gangster film and deal with it episode by episode but start in the middle and move backwards and forwards. Scorsese would compact scenes and realized that if they were kept short, "the impact after about an hour and a half would be terrific". He wanted to do the voiceover like the opening of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_and_Jim" title="Jules and Jim">Jules and Jim</a></i> and use "all the basic tricks of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave" title="French New Wave">New Wave</a> from around 1961". Several of the names of the characters were also changed such as Tommy "Two Gunn" DeSimone becoming Tommy DeVito; Paul Vario becoming Paulie Cicero and Jimmy "The Gent" Burke becoming Jimmy Conway. Since the title of Pileggi's book had already been used for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiseguy" title="Wiseguy">TV series</a> and for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s 1986 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_Guys_(film)" title="Wise Guys (film)">Wise Guys</a></i>, Pileggi and Scorsese decided to change the name of their film to <i>Goodfellas</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once Robert De Niro agreed to play Conway, Scorsese was able to secure the money needed to make the film. The director cast Ray Liotta after De Niro saw him in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Demme" title="Jonathan Demme">Jonathan Demme</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Wild_(1986_film)" title="Something Wild (1986 film)">Something Wild</a></i> and Scorsese was surprised by "his explosive energy" in that film. The actor had read Pileggi's book when it came out and was fascinated by it. A couple of years afterwards, his agent told him that Scorsese was going to direct a film version. In 1988, Liotta met the director over a period of a couple of months and auditioned for the film. The actor campaigned aggressively for a role in the film but the studio wanted a well-known actor. "I think they would've rather had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Murphy" title="Eddie Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> than me", the actor remembers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To prepare for the role, De Niro consulted with Pileggi who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill several times a day to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen because she "thought it would be better if the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role". Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character but found it challenging finding "that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two weeks in advance of the filming, the real <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hill" title="Henry Hill">Henry Hill</a> was paid $480,000. The film was shot on location between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>; and also parts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Island" title="Long Island">Long Island</a> during the spring and summer of 1989 with a budget of $25 million. Scorsese broke the film down into sequences and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard" title="Storyboard">storyboarded</a> everything because of the complicated style throughout. According to the filmmaker, he "wanted lots of movement and I wanted it to be throughout the whole picture, and I wanted the style to kind of break down by the end, so that by his [Henry's] last day as a wiseguy, it's as if the whole picture would be out of control, give the impression he's just going to spin off the edge and fly out." He claims that the film's style comes from the first two or three minutes of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_and_Jim" title="Jules and Jim">Jules and Jim</a></i>: extensive narration, quick edits, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_frame" title="Freeze frame">freeze frames</a>, and multiple locale switches. It was this reckless attitude towards convention that mirrored the attitude of many of the gangsters in the film. Scorsese remarked, "So if you do the movie, you say, 'I don't care if there's too much narration. Too many quick cuts? â€” That's too bad.' It's that kind of really punk attitude we're trying to show". He adopted a frenetic style in order to almost overwhelm the audience with images and information. He also put a lot of detail in every frame because the gangster life is so rich. The use of freeze frames was done because Scorsese wanted images that would stop "because a point was being reached" in Henry's life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Joe Pesci did not judge his character but found the scene where he kills Spider for talking back to his character hard to do because he had trouble justifying the action until he forced himself to feel the way Tommy did. Lorraine Bracco found the shoot to be an emotionally difficult one because it was such a male-dominated cast and realized that if she did not make her "work important, it would probably end up on the cutting room floor". When it came to the relationship between Henry and Karen, Bracco saw no difference between an abused wife and her character.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Pesci, improvisation and ad-libbing came out of rehearsals where Scorsese let the actors do whatever they wanted. He made transcripts of these sessions, took the lines that the actors came up with that he liked best, and put them into a revised script that the cast worked from during principal photography. For example, the scene where Tommy tells a story and Henry is responding to him â€” the "what's so funny about me" scene â€” is based on actual event that happened to Pesci. It was worked on in rehearsals where he and Liotta improvised and Scorsese recorded 4-5 takes, rewrote their dialogue and inserted it into the script. The cast did not meet Henry Hill during the film's shoot but a few weeks before it premiered, Liotta met him in an undisclosed city. Hill had seen the film and told the actor that he loved it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The long tracking shot through the Copacabana nightclub came about because of a practical problem: the filmmakers could not get permission to go in the short way and this forced them to go round the back. Scorsese decided to do it in one shot in order to symbolize Henry's whole life is ahead of him and according to the director. "It's his seduction of her [Karen] and it's also the lifestyle seducing him". This sequence was shot eight times. Henry's last day as a wiseguy was the hardest part of the film for Scorsese to shoot because he wanted to properly show Henry's state of anxiety, paranoia and racing thoughts caused by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamines" title="Amphetamines">amphetamines</a> intoxication, which is difficult for an actor (who had never been under their influence) to accurately portray. The director ended the film with Henry regretting that he is no longer a wiseguy and Scorsese said, "I think the audience should get angry at him and I would hope they do â€” and maybe with the system which allows this".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese wanted to depict the film's violence realistically, "cold, unfeeling and horrible. Almost incidental." However, he had to remove ten frames of blood in order to ensure an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system" title="Motion Picture Association of America film rating system">R rating</a> from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</a>. With a budget of $25 million, <i>Goodfellas</i> was Scorsese's most expensive film to date but still only a medium budget by Hollywood standards. It was also the first time he was obliged by Warner Bros. to preview the film. It was shown twice in California and a lot of audiences were "agitated" by Henry's last day as a wise guy sequence and Scorsese argued that that was the point of the scene. Scorsese and the film's editor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Schoonmaker" title="Thelma Schoonmaker">Thelma Schoonmaker</a>, made this sequence faster with more jump cuts to convey Henry's drug-addled point of view. In the first test screening there were 40 walkouts in the first ten minutes. One of the favorite scenes for test audiences was the one where Tommy tells the story and Henry is responding to him - the "what's so funny about me" scene.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Soundtrack">Soundtrack</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scorsese chose the songs for the soundtrack using only those that commented on the scene or the characters "in an oblique way". The only rule he adhered to with the soundtrack was to only use music that could have been heard at that time. For example, if a scene took place in 1973, he could use any song that was current or older. According to Scorsese, a lot of non-dialogue scenes were shot to playback. For example, he had "Layla" playing on the set while shooting the scene where the dead bodies are discovered in the car and the meat-truck. Sometimes, the lyrics of songs were put between lines of dialogue to comment on the action. Some of the music Scorsese had written into the script while other songs he discovered during the editing phase.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Network_TV_version">Network TV version</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dubbing of the dialogue of the network TV version was personally directed by Scorsese. It added a personal introduction to the film from Scorsese himself. It contains frequent usage of variants of the word "freak", such as "I've got this freakin' gun pointed at your freakin' head." However, much other profanity in the film was retained, as was the violence.</p>

Far worse than <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_(film)" title="The Godfather (film)">The Godfather</a></i>. One killing after another", he said. Scorsese responded to this criticism by saying, "As Nick Pileggi always points out, there are 18 to 20 million Italian-Americans. Out of that, there are only 4,000 alleged organised crime members. But, as Nick says, they cast a very long shadow".</p>
