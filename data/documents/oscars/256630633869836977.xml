	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>John Huston</b> (August 5, 1906 â€“ August 28, 1987) was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> film director, screenwriter and actor. He wrote most of the 37 feature films he directed, many of which are today considered "classics": <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_(1941_film)" title="The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)">The Maltese Falcon</a></i> (1941), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" title="The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></i> (1948), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Largo_(film)" title="Key Largo (film)">Key Largo</a></i> (1948), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asphalt_Jungle" title="The Asphalt Jungle">The Asphalt Jungle</a></i> (1950), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Queen_(film)" title="The African Queen (film)">The African Queen</a></i> (1951), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge_(1952_film)" title="Moulin Rouge (1952 film)">Moulin Rouge</a></i> (1952), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" title="The Misfits (film)">The Misfits</a></i> (1960), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Would_Be_King_(film)" title="The Man Who Would Be King (film)">The Man Who Would Be King</a></i> (1975). During his 46-year career, Huston received 15 Oscar nominations, winning twice, and directed both his father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>, and daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjelica_Huston" title="Anjelica Huston">Anjelica Huston</a> to Oscar wins in different films.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of Huston's films were adaptations of important novels, often depicting a â€œheroic quest," as in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick_(1956_film)" title="Moby Dick (1956 film)">Moby Dick</a></i>, or <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Badge_of_Courage_(film)" title="The Red Badge of Courage (film)">The Red Badge of Courage</a></i>. In many films, different groups of people, while struggling toward a common goal, would become doomed or "destructive alliances,â€&#157; giving the films a dramatic and visual tension. Many of his themes also involved some of the "grand narratives" of the twentieth century, such as religion, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism and war.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Huston has been referred to as "a titan," "a rebel" and a "renaissance man," in the Hollywood film industry. Author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Freer" title="Ian Freer">Ian Freer</a> describes him as "cinema's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway" title="Ernest Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>," â€” a filmmaker who was "never afraid to tackle tough issues head on."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">John Huston was born on August 5, 1906, in Nevada, Missouri. He was the only child of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a> and Reah Gore. His father, who was of Scots and Scots-Irish descent, was an actor, initially in vaudeville, and later in films. His mother, of English and Welsh background, initially worked as a sports editor for various publications but gave it up after Huston was born. Similarly, his father gave up his stage acting career for steady employment as a civil engineer, although he returned to stage acting with a few years. He would later become highly successful on both Broadway and then in motion pictures.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston's parents divorced in 1913, when he was 6, and as a result much of his childhood was spent living in boarding schools. During summer vacations, he traveled with each of his parents separately â€“ with his father on vaudeville tours, and with his mother to racetracks or other sports events. The young Huston benefited greatly from seeing his father act on stage, as he was later drawn to the world of acting. Some critics, such as Lawrence Groble, surmise that his relationship with his mother may have been the cause for why he married five times, and why few of his relationships lasted. Groble writes, "When I interviewed some of the women who had loved him, they inevitably referred to his mother as the key to unlocking Huston's psyche." According to actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a>, "she [his mother] was the central character. I always felt that John was ridden by witches. He seemed pursued by something destructive. If it wasn't his mother, it was his idea of his mother."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a child, he was often ill, and was treated for an enlarged heart and kidney ailments. He recovered after an extended bedridden stay in Arizona, and moved with his mother to Los Angeles, where he went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln_Heights,_Los_Angeles" title="Lincoln Heights, Los Angeles">Lincoln Heights</a> High School. He dropped out of high school after two years in order to become a professional boxer, and by the age of 15 was already a top-ranking amateur lightweight boxer in California. He soon ended his brief boxing career after suffering a broken nose. He also "plunged" himself into a multitude of interests, including abstract painting, ballet, English and French literature, opera, and horseback riding. Living in Los Angeles, he became "infatuated" with the new film industry and motion pictures, but as a spectator only. To Huston, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> was a god."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He moved back to New York to live with his father, who was then acting in a off-Broadway productions, and he obtained a few small roles. From watching his father rehearse, he remembers being fascinated with the mechanics of acting:</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_career_as_writer">Early career as writer</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his stay in Mexico, he wrote a play entitled "Frankie and Johnny," based on the ballad of the same title. After selling it easily, he decided that writing would be a viable career, and he focused on it. His self-esteem was enhanced when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken" title="H. L. Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>, editor of the popular magazine, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Mercury" title="American Mercury">American Mercury</a>,</i> bought two of his stories, â€œFoolâ€&#157; and â€œFigures of Fighting Men.â€&#157; During subsequent years his stories and feature articles were published in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire" title="Esquire">Esquire</a>,</i> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_Arts" title="Theatre Arts">Theatre Arts</a>,</i> and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>.</i> He also worked for a period on the <i>New York Graphic.</i> In 1931, when he was 25, he moved back to Los Angeles with his hopes aimed at writing for the blossoming film industry, where the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent film</a> industry had given way to â€œtalkies,â€&#157; and writers were in demand. In addition, his father had earlier moved there where he was already successful in a number of films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He received a script editing contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwyn_Studios" title="Goldwyn Studios">Goldwyn Studios</a>, but after six months of receiving no assignments, quit to work for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a>, where his father was by then a star. At Universal, he got a job in the script department, and began by writing dialogue for a number of films in 1932, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murders_in_the_Rue_Morgue" title="Murders in the Rue Morgue">Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A_House_Divided_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A House Divided (film) (page does not exist)">A House Divided</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_and_Order_(1932_film)" title="Law and Order (1932 film)">Law and Order</a>. The last two also starred his father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>. In addition, <i>House Divided</i> was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wyler" title="William Wyler">William Wyler</a>, who gave Huston his first real "inside view" of the filmmaking process during all stages of production. Wyler and Huston would also later become close friends and collaborators on a number of leading films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston gained a reputation as a "lusty, hard-drinking libertine" during his first years as a writer in Hollywood. Huston describes those years as a "series of misadventures and disappointments," however. His brief career as a Hollywood writer ended suddenly after a car he was driving struck and killed a young female pedestrian. He was absolved of blame by a coroner's jury, but the incident left him "traumatized" nonetheless, and he moved to London and Paris, living as a "drifter."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1937, after five years, the 31-year-old Huston returned to Hollywood intent on being a "serious writer." He also married Lesley Black. His first job was as scriptwriter with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers_Studio" title="Warner Brothers Studio">Warner Brothers Studio</a>, with his personal longterm goal of directing his own scripts. For the next four years, he co-wrote scripts for major films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel" title="Jezebel">Jezebel</a>,</i> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Dr._Clitterhouse" title="The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse">The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juarez_(1939_film)" title="Juarez (1939 film)">Juarez</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Ehrlich%27s_Magic_Bullet" title="Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet">Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergeant_York" title="Sergeant York">Sergeant York</a></i> (1941). He was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for his writing both <i>Ehrlich</i> and <i>Sergeant York.</i> Huston writes that <i>Sergeant York</i>, which was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hawks" title="Howard Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>, has "gone down as one of Howard's best pictures, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> had a triumph playing the young mountaineer."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next script he was given to work on was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Sierra_(film)" title="High Sierra (film)">High Sierra</a></i> (1941), to be directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Walsh" title="Raoul Walsh">Raoul Walsh</a>. The film became the hit Huston wanted. It also made <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> a star with his first major role, as a gunman on the run. Warners kept their end of the bargain, and gave Huston his choice of subject.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Screenwriter_and_director">Screenwriter and director</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For his first directing assignment, Huston chose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiell_Hammett" title="Dashiell Hammett">Dashiell Hammett</a>'s detective thriller, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Maltese_Falcon_(1941_film)" title="The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)">The Maltese Falcon</a>, a film which had already failed at the box office in two earlier versions by Warners. However, studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> approved of Huston's treatment of Hammett's 1930 novel, as he stood by his word to let Huston choose his first subject.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston kept the screenplay close to the novel, keeping much of Hammett's dialogue, and directing it in an uncluttered style, much like the book's narrative. He also did the unusual preparation for this, his first directing job, by sketching out each shot beforehand, including camera positions, lighting, and compositional scale, for such things as closeups.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He especially benefited by selecting a superior cast, giving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> the lead role. Bogart was happy to take the role, as he liked working with Huston. In addition, the supporting cast included other noted actors: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astor" title="Mary Astor">Mary Astor</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Lorre" title="Peter Lorre">Peter Lorre</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Greenstreet" title="Sydney Greenstreet">Sydney Greenstreet</a> (his first film role), and his own father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>. The film, however, was given only a small B-movie budget, and received minimal publicity by Warners, as they had low expectations. The entire film was made in eight weeks for only $300,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon receiving immediate enthusiastic response by the public and critics, Warners was surprised. Critics hailed the film as a "classic," and up until the present day it is claimed by many to be the "best detective melodrama ever made." <i>Herald Tribune</i> critic Howard Barnes called it a "triumph." Huston again received an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay. After this film, Huston would from then on direct all of his screenplays, except for one, <i>Three Strangers</i> (1946). In 1942, he directed two more hits, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_This_Our_Life" title="In This Our Life">In This Our Life</a></i> (1942), starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_the_Pacific" title="Across the Pacific">Across the Pacific</a></i>, another thriller starring Humphrey Bogart.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1942 he was activated by the U.S. Army to work with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Signal_Corps" title="Army Signal Corps">Army Signal Corps</a> as a captain, in order to act as a filmmaker. While in uniform, he directed and produced three films that some critics rank as "among the finest made about World War II: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report_from_the_Aleutians" title="Report from the Aleutians">Report from the Aleutians</a></i> (1943), about soldiers preparing for combat; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_San_Pietro" title="The Battle of San Pietro">The Battle of San Pietro</a></i> (1944), the story (censored by the Army) of a failure by America's intelligence agencies which resulted in many deaths, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_There_Be_Light_(film)" title="Let There Be Light (film)">Let There Be Light</a></i> (1945), about psychologically damaged veterans, also censored for 35 years, until 1981. He rose to the rank of major and received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_of_Merit" title="Legion of Merit">Legion of Merit</a> award for "courageous work under battle conditions." Nonetheless, all of his films made for the Army were "controversial," and either not released, censored, or banned outright, as they were considered "demoralizing" to soldiers and the public. Years later, after moving to Ireland, his daughter, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjelica_Huston" title="Anjelica Huston">Anjelica Huston</a>, recalled that the "main movies we watched were the war documentaries."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon returning to Hollywood once the war was over, he co-wrote the film, <i>The Stranger</i> (1946), although he was not credited. The film was directed and produced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>, who also acted the part of a Nazi war criminal who manages to settle in New England under an assumed name.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next picture, which he wrote and directed, was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Treasure_of_the_Sierra_Madre_(film)" title="The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)">The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</a></i> (1948). It would become one of films which established his reputation as a leading filmmaker. The film, again starring Humphrey Bogart, was the story of three drifters who band together to prospect for gold, find it, but lose it in the end, as they all became obsessed by greed. Huston also gave a supporting role to his father, Walter Huston.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers_Studio" title="Warner Brothers Studio">Warners</a> studio was initially uncertain what to make of the film. They had allowed Huston to film on location in Mexico, which was a "radical move" for a studio at the time. They also knew that Huston was gaining a reputation as "one of the wild men of Hollywood." In any case, studio boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> initially "detested it." But whatever doubts Warners had were soon removed, as the film achieved widespread public and critical acclaim. Hollywood writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a> called "one of the most beautiful and visually alive moves I have ever seen." <i>Time</i> magazine described it as "one of the best things Hollywood has done since it learned to talk." Huston won Oscars for best director and best screenplay; his father won for best supporting actor. It also won other awards in the U.S. and overseas. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Comment" title="Film Comment">Film Comment</a></i> magazine devoted four pages to the film in its Mayâ€“June, 1980 edition, with author Richard T. Jameson offering his impressions:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1948 he directed his next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_Largo_(film)" title="Key Largo (film)">Key Largo</a></i>, again with Humphrey Bogart starring. It was the story about a disillusioned returning veteran clashing with gangsters on a remote Florida key. It co-starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Trevor" title="Claire Trevor">Claire Trevor</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>. The film was an adaptation of the stage play by Maxwell Anderson, and the film itself seemed overly stage-bound for many viewers. However, the "outstanding performances" by all the actors saved the film, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Trevor" title="Claire Trevor">Claire Trevor</a> won an Oscar for best supporting actress. Huston was annoyed that the studio cut several scenes from the final release without his agreement. That, along with some earlier disputes, angered Huston enough that he left the studio when his contract expired.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1950 he wrote and directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asphalt_Jungle" title="The Asphalt Jungle">The Asphalt Jungle</a></i>, a film which broke new ground by depicting criminals as somewhat sympathetic characters, simply doing their professional work, "an occupation like any other," or what Huston calls "a left-handed form of human endeavor." Huston achieved that effect by giving "deep attention" to the plot, involving a large jewelry theft, by examining the minute, step by step details and difficulties each of the characters had of carrying it out. In doing so, some critics felt that Huston had achieved an almost "documentary" style.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> considers it to be "Huston's best film," and the film that made <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> a recognized actress. Sarris also notes the similar themes in many of Huston's films, as exemplified by this one: "His protagonists almost invariably fail at what they set out to do." This theme was also similar to the story in <i>Treasure of the Serra Madre</i>, where greed became the cause of the group's undoing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterling_Hayden" title="Sterling Hayden">Sterling Hayden</a> and Huston's personal friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jaffe" title="Sam Jaffe">Sam Jaffe</a>. It also became the first serious role for Marilyn Monroe, according to Huston: "it was, of course, where Marilyn Monroe got her start." The film succeeded at the box office and Huston was again nominated for an Oscar for best screenplay and best director, along with winning the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Directors_Guild" title="Screen Directors Guild">Screen Directors Guild</a> Award. It would subsequently become a model for many similar movies by other filmmakers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After completing <i>The Asphalt Jungle</i>, Huston's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Badge_of_Courage_(film)" title="The Red Badge of Courage (film)">The Red Badge of Courage</a></i> (1951), was of a completely different subject: war and its effect on soldiers. While in the army during World War II, he became interested in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Crane" title="Stephen Crane">Stephen Crane</a>'s classic American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> novel of the same title. For the starring role, Huston chose World War II hero <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Murphy" title="Audie Murphy">Audie Murphy</a> to play the young Union soldier who deserts his company out of fear, but later returns to fight alongside them. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a>, however, saw the message of the movie as too antiwar. Without Huston's input, they cut down the running time of the film from eighty-eight minutes to sixty-nine, added narration, and deleted what Huston felt was a crucial scene.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie did poorly at the box office. Huston suggests that it was possibly because it "brought war very close to home."  Huston recalls that at the preview showing, before the film was halfway through, "damn near a third of the audience got up and walked out of the theater." Despite the "butchering" and weak public response, film historian Michael Barson describes the movie as "a minor masterpiece."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the <i>Asphalt Jungle</i> opened in theaters, Huston was already in Africa shooting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Queen_(film)" title="The African Queen (film)">The African Queen</a></i> (1951), a story based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Forester" title="C. S. Forester">C. S. Forester</a>'s popular novel. It starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> in a combination of romance, comedy and adventure. Barson calls it "one of the most popular Hollywood movies of all time." The film's producer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a> urged Huston to change the ending to allow the protagonists to survive, instead of dying. Huston agreed, and the ending was rewritten. It became Huston's most successful film financially, and "it remains one of his finest works." Huston was nominated for two Academy Awardsâ€”best director and best screenplay. Bogart, however, won an Oscar for best actor, his first time winning.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1952 Huston moved to Ireland as a result of his "disgust" at the "witch-hunt" and the "moral rot" he felt was created by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Committee_on_Un-American_Activities" title="House Committee on Un-American Activities">House Committee on Un-American Activities</a> (HUAC), which had affected many of his friends in the movie industry. Huston had, with friends including director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wyler" title="William Wyler">William Wyler</a> and screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Dunne" title="Philip Dunne">Philip Dunne</a>, established the â€œCommittee for the First Amendment,â€&#157; as a response to the on-going government investigations into communists within the film industry. The HUAC was calling numerous filmmakers, screenwriters, and actors to testify about any past affiliations.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston produced, wrote, and directed his next three films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moulin_Rouge_(1952_film)" title="Moulin Rouge (1952 film)">Moulin Rouge</a></i> (1953); <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_the_Devil_(1953_film)" title="Beat the Devil (1953 film)">Beat the Devil</a></i> (1953); and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick_(1956_film)" title="Moby Dick (1956 film)">Moby Dick</a></i> (1956). He had been planning to film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville" title="Herman Melville">Herman Melville</a>'s <i>Moby Dick</i> for the previous ten years, and originally saw it as an excellent part for his father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>. However, his father died in 1950, and he chose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a> to play the starring role of Captain Ahab. Science fiction writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> helped write the script. The movie was filmed over a three-year period on location in Ireland, where Huston was then living. The fishing village of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Bedford,_Massachusetts" title="New Bedford, Massachusetts">New Bedford, Massachusetts</a> was recreated along the waterfront; the sailing ship in the film was fully constructed to be seaworthy; and three 100-foot whales were built out of steel, wood, and plastic. However, the film failed at the box office, with some critics, like David Robinson, suggesting that the movie lacked the "mysticism of the book" and thereby "loses its significance."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of his next five films, only <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" title="The Misfits (film)">The Misfits</a></i> (1961), found critical approval. However, critics have noted the "retrospective atmosphere of doom" which now hangs over the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>, the star, died of a heart attack a few days before the filming was completed; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> never did another film and died of apparent suicide a year later; and costars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Ritter" title="Thelma Ritter">Thelma Ritter</a> also died over the next few years. During the filming itself, Monroe was often on drugs of various kinds, which led to her arriving late on the set and often forgetting her lines. Monroe's problems also led to the breakup of her marriage to the film's scriptwriter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, "virtually on set." Huston later commented about this period in her career: "Marilyn was on her way out. Not only of the picture, but of life."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He followed <i>The Misfits</i> with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freud:_The_Secret_Passion" title="Freud: The Secret Passion">Freud: The Secret Passion</a></i>, a film quite different from most of his others. Besides directing, he also narrates portions of the story. Film historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_M._Kaminsky" title="Stuart M. Kaminsky">Stuart M. Kaminsky</a> notes that Huston presents <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>, "as a kind of savior and messiah," with an "almost Biblical detachment." As the film begins, Huston describes Freud as a "kind of hero or God on a quest for mankind":</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_De_Laurentis" title="Dino De Laurentis">Dino De Laurentis</a> traveled to Ireland to ask Huston to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible:_In_The_Beginning" title="The Bible: In The Beginning">The Bible: In The Beginning</a></i>. Although De Laurentis had ambitions for a broader story, he realized that the subject could not be adequately covered and limited the story to the first half of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis" title="Book of Genesis">Book of Genesis</a>. Huston enjoyed directing the film, as it gave him a chance to indulge his love of animals. Besides directing he also played the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah" title="Noah">Noah</a> and the voice of God. The film did poorly at the box office, however, and at a cost of 18 million dollars, it was the most expensive movie in his career. Huston likes describing details about the filming:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toward the end of his career he also began to act in various films. In 1963, director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Preminger" title="Otto Preminger">Otto Preminger</a> asked if he would portray a Boston prelate in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cardinal" title="The Cardinal">The Cardinal</a></i>, and, writes author Philip Kemp, he "virtually stole the picture." He was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a> for his role. He acted in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski" title="Roman Polanski">Roman Polanski's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(film)" title="Chinatown (film)">Chinatown</a></i> (1974) as the film's central corrupt businessman, in 1974, and as Teddy Roosevelt's advisor Johy Hay in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wind_and_the_Lion" title="The Wind and the Lion">The Wind and the Lion</a></i>. Huston enjoyed acting and denied that he took it all that seriously, however: "It's a cinch," he once said, "and they pay you damn near as much as you make directing."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston is also famous to a generation of fans of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien" title="J. R. R. Tolkien">J. R.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston's films were insightful about human nature and human predicaments. They also sometimes included scenes or brief dialogue passages that were remarkably prescient concerning environmental issues that came to public awareness in the future, in the period starting about 1970; examples include and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_Iguana_(film)" title="The Night of the Iguana (film)">The Night of the Iguana</a></i> (1964). <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" title="The Misfits (film)">The Misfits</a></i>. Huston spent long evenings carousing in the Nevada casinos after filming, surrounded by reporters and beautiful women, gambling, drinking, and smoking cigars.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Movie_themes">Movie themes</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Kaminsky, Hustonâ€™s stories were often about â€œfailed questsâ€&#157; by a group of different people. The group would persist in the face of poor odds, doomed at the outset by the circumstances created by an impossible situation. However, some members of the doomed group usually survive, those who are â€œcoolâ€&#157; and â€œintelligent,â€&#157; or someone who â€œwill sacrifice everything for self-understanding and independence.â€&#157; Those types of characters are exemplified by Bogart in <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, and Montgomery Clift in <i>Freud.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another type of quest often seen in Hustonâ€™s films involve a pair of potential lovers tying to face a hostile world. Flint adds, however, that he â€œbucked Hollywoodâ€™s penchant for happy endings,â€&#157; and many of his stories ended with â€œlove unsatisfied.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film historian James Goodwin adds that in virtually all of his films, there is some type of â€œheroic questâ€”even if it involves questionable motives or destructive alliances.â€&#157; In addition, the quest â€œis preferable to the spiritless, amoral routines of life.â€&#157; As a result, his best films, according to Flint, â€œhave lean, fast-paced scripts and vibrant plots and characterizations, and many of them deal ironically with vanity, avarice and unfulfilled quests.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, in the opinion of critics Tony Tracy and Roddy Flynn, "what fundamentally fascinated Huston was not movies <i>per se</i> â€” that is, form â€” but the human condition . . . and literature offered a road map for exploring that condition." In many of his films, therefore, he tried to express his interest by developing themes involving some of the "grand narratives" of the twentieth century, such as "faith, meaning, truth, freedom, psychology, colonialism, war and capitalism."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To Jameson, all of Hustonâ€™s films are adaptations, and he believes that through his films there was a â€œcohesive world-view, not only thematically but also stylistically; there is the Huston look.â€&#157; The â€œHuston lookâ€&#157; was also noted by screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a>, who adds that this â€œlook proceeds from Hustonâ€™s sense of what is natural to the eye and his delicate, simple feeling for space relationships.â€&#157; In any case, notes Flint, Huston took â€œuncommon care to preserve the writerâ€™s styles and values . . . and sought repeatedly to transpose the interior essence of literature to film with dramatic and visual tension,â€&#157; as he did in <i>Red Badge of Courage,</i> <i>Moby Dick,</i> and <i>Under the Volcano.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Religion is also a theme that runs through many of Hustonâ€™s films. In <i>The Night of the Iguana,</i> Kaminsky notes how <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>, while preaching a sermon to his congregation, seems â€œlost, confused, his speech is gibberish,â€&#157; and leads his congregation to turn away from him. In other films, adds Kaminsky, religion is seen as â€œpart of the fantasy world,â€&#157; that the actors must overcome to survive physically or emotionally. â€œThese religious zealots counsel a move away from the pleasure of the world and human love, a world that Huston believes in,â€&#157; concludes Kaminsky. Such religious themes were also seen in <i>The Bible,</i> and <i>Wise Blood,</i> for example.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To Barson, however, Huston was among the â€œleast consistentâ€&#157; filmmakers, although he concludes that he was one of the â€œmost interesting directors of the past sixty years.â€&#157; Throughout his long career, many of his films did poorly and were criticized as a result. To a writer in 1972 he commented, "Criticism isn't a new experience for me. Pictures that are now thought of as, forgive the term, classics, weren't all that well thought of at the time they came out." After an interview a few years before he died, the reporter writes that â€œHuston said he missed the major studio era when people savored making movies, not just money.â€&#157;</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Directing_techniques">Directing techniques</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stevens,_Jr." title="George Stevens, Jr.">George Stevens, Jr.</a> notes that while many directors rely on post-production editing to shape their final work, Huston instead created his films while they were being shot: â€œI donâ€™t even know the editor of my films most of the time,â€&#157; Huston said. Actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Caine" title="Michael Caine">Michael Caine</a> also observed the same technique: â€œMost directors donâ€™t know what they want so they shoot everything they can think ofâ€”they use the camera like a machine gun. John uses it like a sniper.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film writer Peter Flint also agrees and points out other benefits to that style: â€œHe shot economically, eschewing the many protective shots favored by timid directors, and edited cerebrally so that financial backers would have trouble trying to cut scenes.â€&#157; Huston shot most of his films on location, working â€œintenselyâ€&#157; six days a week, and â€œon Sundays, played equally intense poker with the cast and crew.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Kaminsky, much of Hustonâ€™s vision probably came from his early experience as a painter on the streets of Paris. While there, he studied art and worked at it for a year and a half. Huston continued painting as a hobby for most of his life. Kaminsky also notes that most of Hustonâ€™s films â€œreflected this prime interest in the image, the moving portrait and the use of color.â€&#157; Huston explored the use of "stylistic framing," especially well-planned close-ups, in much of his directing. In his first film, <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, for instance, Huston sketched out all of his scenes beforehand, â€œlike canvases of paintings.â€&#157; His daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjelica_Huston" title="Anjelica Huston">Anjelica Huston</a> adds that even for his subsequent films, he sketched storyboards "constantly." She agrees that for her father, "it was a form of study, and my father was a painter, a very good one." She also notes that "there was an extremely developed sensory quality about my father, he didn't miss a trick."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston received 15 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> nominations in the course of his career, and is the oldest person ever to be nominated for the Best Director Oscar when, at 79 years old, he was nominated for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prizzi%27s_Honor" title="Prizzi's Honor">Prizzi's Honor</a></i> (1985).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Huston loved the outdoors, especially sports such as hunting while living in Ireland. He claimed that he had no orthodox religion. Among his lifeâ€™s adventures before becoming a Hollywood filmmaker, he had been an amateur boxer, reporter, short-story writer, portrait artist in Paris, a cavalry rider in Mexico, and a documentary filmmaker during World War II. Besides sports and adventure, he enjoyed hard liquor and relationships with women of all types â€“ one of the reasons he was married five times. Stevens describes him as someone who â€œlived life to its fullest.â€&#157; Barson even suggests that Hustonâ€™s â€œflamboyant lifeâ€&#157; as a rebel would possibly make for â€œan even more engaging tale than most of his movies.â€&#157;</p>
