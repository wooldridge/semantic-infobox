The official announcement of the cause and manner of Ledger's death heightened concerns about the growing problems of prescription drug abuse or misuse and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_drug_intoxication" title="Combined drug intoxication">Combined Drug Intoxication</a> (CDI).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Late in February 2008, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Agency" title="Drug Enforcement Agency">DEA</a> investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicians" title="Physicians">physicians</a>, who practice in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, of any wrongdoing, determining that "the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications â€“ not the pills that killed him."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 4 August 2008, citing unnamed sources, Murray Weiss, of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>, first reported that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary-Kate_Olsen" title="Mary-Kate Olsen">Mary-Kate Olsen</a> had "refused [through her attorney, Michael C.

[without] ... <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunity_from_prosecution" title="Immunity from prosecution">immunity</a> from prosecution," and that, when asked about the matter, Miller at first declined further comment. Later that day, after the police confirmed the gist of Weiss's account to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press" title="Associated Press">Associated Press</a>, Miller issued a statement denying that Olsen supplied Ledger with the drugs causing his death and asserting that she did not know their source." In his statement, Miller said specifically: "Despite tabloid speculation, Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger's home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them," emphasizing that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">media</a> "descriptions [attributed to an unidentified source] are incomplete and inaccurate."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a flurry of further <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">media</a> speculation, on 6 August 2008, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Southern_District_of_New_York" title="United States District Court for the Southern District of New York">U.S. Attorney's Office</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">Manhattan</a> closed its investigation into Ledger's death without filing any charges and rendering <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mootness" title="Mootness">moot</a> its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena" title="Subpoena">subpoena</a> of Olsen. With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office "don't believe there's a viable target," it is still not known how Ledger obtained the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxycodone" title="Oxycodone">oxycodone</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocodone" title="Hydrocodone">hydrocodone</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_drug_intoxication" title="Combined drug intoxication">lethal drug combination</a> that killed him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eleven months after Ledger's death, on 23 December 2008, Jake Coyle, writing for the Associated Press, announced that "Heath Ledger's death was voted 2008's top entertainment story by U.S. newspaper and broadcast editors surveyed by The Associated Press," as it resulted in: "shock and confusion" about "the circumstances", the ruling of the death as an accident caused by "a toxic combination of prescription drugs", and the continuation of "his legacy... [i]n a roundly acclaimed performance as the Joker in the year's biggest box office hit <i>The Dark Knight</i>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Ledger's death, in response to some press reports about his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_(law)" title="Will (law)">will</a>, filed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> on 28 February 2008, and his daughter's access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of his granddaughter Matilda Rose the Ledger family's "absolute priority" and her mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(actress)" title="Michelle Williams (actress)">Michelle Williams</a>, "an integral part of our family", adding "They will be taken care of and that's how Heath would want it to be". Some of Ledger's relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_(law)" title="Estate (law)">estate</a> between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose. Williams' father, Larry Williams, has also joined the controversy about Ledger's will as it was filed in New York City soon after his death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 31 March 2008, stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledger's estate, Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an "Exclusive" report, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph_(Australia)" title="The Daily Telegraph (Australia)">The Daily Telegraph</a></i>, citing Ledger's uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members, who "believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child" when he was 17, and stating that "If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girl's biological father, it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child." A few days later, reports citing telephone interviews with Ledger's uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl, published in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK!" title="OK!">OK!</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Us_Weekly" title="Us Weekly">Us Weekly</a></i>, "denied" those "claims", with Ledger's uncles and the little girl's mother and stepfather describing them as unfounded "rumors" distorted and exaggerated by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media" title="Mass media">media</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 15 July 2008, Fife-Yeomans reported further, via Australian <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Limited" title="News Limited">News Limited</a>,</i> that "While Ledger left everything to his parents and three sisters, it is understood they have legal advice that under <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" title="Western Australia">WA</a> law, Matilda Rose is entitled to the lion's share" of his estate; its <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executor" title="Executor">executors</a>, Kim Ledger's former business colleague Robert John Collins and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraldton,_Western_Australia" title="Geraldton, Western Australia">Geraldton</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant" title="Accountant">accountant</a> William Mark Dyson, "have applied for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probate" title="Probate">probate</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_Western_Australia" title="Supreme Court of Western Australia">West Australian Supreme Court</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia" title="Perth, Western Australia">Perth</a>, advertising "for '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creditor" title="Creditor">creditors</a> and other persons' having claims on the estate to lodge them by 11 August 2008 ... to ensure all debts are paid before the estate is distributed...." According to this report by Fife-Yeomans, earlier reports citing Ledger's uncles, and subsequent reports citing Ledger's father, which do not include his actual posthumous earnings, "his entire fortune, mostly held in Australian trusts, is likely to be worth up to [A]<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_dollar" title="Australian dollar">$</a>20 million."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 27 September 2008, Ledger's father Kim stated that "the family has agreed to leave the [US]<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>16.3 million fortune to Matilda," adding: "There is no claim. Our family has gifted everything to Matilda." In October 2008, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes.com</a></i> estimated Ledger's annual earnings from October 2007 through October 2008 â€“ including his posthumous share of <i>The Dark Knight'</i>s gross income of "[US]<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>991 million in box office revenue worldwide" â€“â€“ as "[US]<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>20 million."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ledger's death affected the marketing campaign for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Nolan" title="Christopher Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s <i>The Dark Knight</i> (2008) and also both the production and marketing of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Gilliam" title="Terry Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s film <i>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</i>, with both directors intending to celebrate and pay tribute to his work in these films. Although Gilliam temporarily suspended production on the latter film, he expressed determination to "salvage" it, perhaps using <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI), and dedicated it to Ledger. In February 2008, as a "memorial tribute to the man many have called one of the best actors of his generation," <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Law" title="Jude Law">Jude Law</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Farrell" title="Colin Farrell">Colin Farrell</a> signed on to take over Ledger's role, becoming multiple incarnations of his character, Tony, transformed in this "magical re-telling of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faust</a> story," and the three actors have donated their fees for the film to Ledger's and Williams' daughter.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Speaking of editing <i>The Dark Knight,</i> on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, "It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ... But the truth is, I feel very lucky to have something productive to do, to have a performance that he was very, very proud of, and that he had entrusted to me to finish." All of Ledger's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no "digital effects" to alter Ledger's actual performance posthumously. Nolan dedicated the film in part to Ledger's memory, as well as to the memory of technician Conway Wickliffe, who was killed during a car accident while preparing one of the film's stunts.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Released in July 2008, <i>The Dark Knight</i> broke several <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office" title="Box office">box office</a> records and received both popular and critical accolades, especially with regard to Ledger's performance as the Joker. Even film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Denby_(film_critic)" title="David Denby (film critic)">David Denby</a>, who does not praise the film overall in his pre-release review in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>, evaluates Ledger's work highly, describing his performance as both "sinister and frightening" and Ledger as "mesmerising in every scene", concluding: "His performance is a heroic, unsettling final act: this young actor looked into the abyss." Attempting to dispel widespread speculations that Ledger's performance as the Joker had in any way led to his death (as Denby and others suggest), Ledger's co-star and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bale" title="Christian Bale">Christian Bale</a>, who played opposite him as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>, has stressed that, as an actor, Ledger greatly enjoyed meeting the challenges of creating that role, an experience that Ledger himself described as "the most fun Iâ€™ve ever had, or probably ever will have, playing a character."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ledger received numerous awards for his Joker role in <i>The Dark Knight</i>. On 10 November 2008, he was nominated for two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Choice_Awards" title="People's Choice Awards">People's Choice Awards</a> related to his work on the film, "Best Ensemble Cast" and "Best Onscreen Match-Up" (shared with Christian Bale), and Ledger won an award for "Match-Up" in the ceremony aired live on CBS in January 2009.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 11 December 2008, it was announced that Ledger had been nominated for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor â€“ Motion Picture">Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor â€“ Motion Picture</a> for his performance as the Joker in <i>The Dark Knight</i>; he subsequently won the award at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/66th_Golden_Globe_Awards" title="66th Golden Globe Awards">66th Golden Globe Awards</a> ceremony telecast on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> on 11Â January 2009 with <i>Dark Knight</i> director Christopher Nolan accepting on his behalf.</p>

Although he warns Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a physical and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, during which each is bloodied.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his long-time <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianc%C3%A9e" title="FiancÃ©e">fiancÃ©e</a> Alma Beers (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Williams_(actress)" title="Michelle Williams (actress)">Michelle Williams</a>) and fathers two children. Jack returns the next summer, but Aguirre, who witnessed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, does not hire him. Jack meets, marries and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(actress)" title="Anne Hathaway (actress)">Anne Hathaway</a>). After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting the two kiss passionately, which Alma accidentally witnesses.

Ennis sees his family regularly until Alma finally reveals her knowledge of the nature of his relationship with Jack and has a violent argument with Ennis. Lureen has abandoned her rodeo days and become a businesswoman with her father and expects Jack to work in sales. Hearing about Ennis's divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming hoping they can live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with a waitress, Cassie Cartwright (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Cardellini" title="Linda Cardellini">Linda Cardellini</a>). Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sometime later, a postcard Ennis sends to Jack is returned stamped "Deceased". In a telephone conversation, Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died when a tire he was changing exploded; while listening, Ennis imagines Jack being beaten to death by a gang. Jack's actual fate is left "deliberately ambiguous". Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is. Ennis travels to meet with Jack's mother and father (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberta_Maxwell" title="Roberta Maxwell">Roberta Maxwell</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McRobbie" title="Peter McRobbie">Peter McRobbie</a>), where he offers to take Jack's ashes - but the father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. In Jack's childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he lost on Brokeback Mountain, realizing that Jack kept it hanging with the bloodstained shirt Jack himself wore during that fight. Ennis holds them up to his face, breathing in their scent and silently weeping. Jack's mother allows him to keep the shirts.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Mara" title="Kate Mara">Kate Mara</a>) arrives at her father's trailer with the news that she is engaged. She asks Ennis for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancÃ© really loves her, and she answers "yes". After Alma's departure, Ennis goes to his closet. Hanging on a nail pounded into the door are the shirts, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. Now Jack's shirt is tucked inside of Ennis's. Ennis fastens the top button of Jack's shirt, and with tears in his eyes mutters, "Jack, I swear..." while straightening the postcard, before closing the door and walking away.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was the highest-grossing film in the U.S. from January 17 through January 19, 2006, perhaps due primarily to its wins at the Golden Globes on January 16.

The film was given a "two thumbs up" rating by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Movies_(U.S._TV_series)" title="At the Movies (U.S. TV series)">Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper</a>, the former giving a four-star review in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i>. The film received positive reviews from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_Today" title="Christianity Today">Christianity Today</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism" title="Conservatism">Conservative</a> radio host <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Medved" title="Michael Medved">Michael Medved</a> gave the film three and a half stars, stating that while the film's "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_agenda" title="Homosexual agenda">agenda</a>" is blatant, it is an artistic work.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's significance has been attributed to its portrayal of a same-sex relationship without any reference to the history of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_social_movements" title="LGBT social movements">gay civil rights movement</a>. This emphasizes the tragic love story aspect, which leads many commentators to effectively compare Ennis and Jack's drama to classic and modern romances like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i> or <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i>, often using the term <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star-crossed" title="Star-crossed">star-crossed lovers</a>. This link to classic romances is no coincidence: the poster for the film was inspired by that of James Cameron's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanic_(1997_film)" title="Titanic (1997 film)">Titanic</a></i>, after Ang Lee's collaborator James Schamus looked at the posters of "the 50 most romantic movies ever made".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There was also disagreement among reviewers, critics, and even the cast and crew as to whether the film's two protagonists were actually gay, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality" title="Bisexuality">bisexual</a>, heterosexual, or under no sexual label at all. Most often the film was referred to in the media as the "gay cowboy movie," but a number of reviewers wrote that Jack and Ennis were bisexual. Sex researcher <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Klein" title="Fritz Klein">Fritz Klein</a> also asserted his opinion that the film was "a nice film with two main characters who were bisexual", and further analyzed that Jack is more "toward the gay side of bisexuality" and Ennis is "a bit more toward the straight side of being bisexual". In an article in <i>American Sexuality Magazine</i>, bisexual activist Amy Andre critiqued the media's avoidance of the use of the term "bisexual" in association with <i>Brokeback Mountain</i>:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gyllenhaal himself took the opinion that Ennis and Jack were heterosexual men who "develop this love, this bond," also saying in a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Details_(magazine)" title="Details (magazine)">Details</a></i> interview: "I approached the story believing that these are actually two straight guys who fall in love." Still others stated that they felt the characters' sexuality to be simply ambiguous. Clarence Patton and Christopher Murray said in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York's</a> <i>Gay City News</i> that Ennis and Jack's experiences were metaphors for "many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_who_have_sex_with_men" title="Men who have sex with men">men who do not identify as gay or even queer, but who nevertheless have sex with other men</a>". A reviewer at Filmcritic.com wrote, "We later see Jack eagerly engage Lureen sexually, with no explanation as to whether he is bisexual, so in need of physical intimacy that anyone, regardless of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender" title="Gender">gender</a>, will do, or merely very adept at faking it." Ledger was quoted as stating in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>: "I don't think Ennis could be labeled as gay. Without Jack Twist, I don't know that he ever would have come out.... I think the whole point was that it was two souls that fell in love with each other." Conversely, others stated that the characters were undoubtedly gay, including GLBT non-fiction author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Marcus" title="Eric Marcus">Eric Marcus</a>, who dismissed "talk of Ennis and Jack being anything but gay as box office-influenced political correctness intended to steer straight audiences to the film". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> also agrees that both characters are gay, although in doubt of it: "Jack is able to accept a little more willingly that he is inescapably gay," and the film's producer James Schamus said, "I suppose movies can be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test" title="Rorschach test">Rorschach tests</a> for all of us, but damn if these characters aren't gay to me." Annie Proulx herself opined "how different readers take the story is a reflection of their own personal values, attitudes, hang-ups."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Ledger and Gyllenhaal were asked about any fear of being cast in such controversial roles, Ledger responded that he was not afraid of the role, but rather he was concerned that he would not be mature enough as an actor to do the story justice. Gyllenhaal has stated that he is extremely proud of the film and his role, regardless of what the reactions would be. Although he has repeatedly stated that he is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterosexuality" title="Heterosexuality">heterosexual</a>, he regards rumors of him being bisexual as flattering. Both have stated that the sex scenes in the beginning were difficult to do. Lee found the first scene difficult to film and has stated he has great respect for the two main actors for their "courage". Ledger's performance was described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Davies" title="Luke Davies">Luke Davies</a> as a difficult and empowering portrayal given the environment of the film, stating: "In <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> the vulnerability, the potential for danger, is so great - a world so masculine it might destroy you for any aberration - that [Ledger's] real brilliance was to bring to the screen a character, Ennis Del Mar, so fundamentally shut down that he is like a bible of unrequited desires, stifled yearnings, lost potential."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On January 3, 2006, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>, the studio of which Focus Features is the specialty division, announced that <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was the most honored film of 2005. The independent website criticstop10.com backed that assertion, reporting that <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> was the most frequently selected film on reviewers' year-end Top Ten lists of 2005. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> put it on its end-of-the-decade, "best-of" list, saying, "Everyone called it "The Gay Cowboy Movie." Until they saw it. In the end, Ang Lee's 2005 love story wasn't gay or straight, just human."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On March 9, 2006, <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> made the news yet again when a press release was sent to more than 400 media outlets announcing that nearly $26,000 had been raised for an ad to be posted in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Daily Variety</a></i> on March 10, 2006. This $26,000 had been raised by just over 600 fans through an online donations site, affiliated with a non-studio-sponsored online forum which is devoted to the film and the book. The story was quickly picked up by several outlets including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!" title="Yahoo!">Yahoo!</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advocate" title="The Advocate">The Advocate</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>.

The film had grossed more than $160 million as of the date of his lawsuit, which sought $10 million plus punitive damages. On May 5, Quaid dropped his lawsuit.
