The film was adapted by Stone and Zachary Sklar from the books <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Trail_of_the_Assassins" title="On the Trail of the Assassins">On the Trail of the Assassins</a></i> by Jim Garrison and <i>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Marrs" title="Jim Marrs">Jim Marrs</a>. Stone described his fictionalized film as a "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_assassination_conspiracy_theories" title="Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories">counter-myth</a>" to the "fictional myth" of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission" title="Warren Commission">Warren Commission</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film became embroiled in controversy even before it was finished filming, after <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> national security correspondent George Lardner showed up on the set. Based on the first draft of the screenplay, he wrote a scathing article attacking the film. Upon <i>JFK'</i>s theatrical release, many major American newspapers ran editorials accusing Stone of taking liberties with historical facts, including the film's implication that President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson" title="Lyndon B.

After a slow start at the box office, Stone's film gradually picked up momentum, earning over $205 million in worldwide gross. <i>JFK</i> went on to win two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> and was nominated for eight in total, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Synopsis">Synopsis</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opens with newsreel footage, including the farewell address in 1961 of outgoing President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, warning about the build-up of the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military-industrial_complex" title="Military-industrial complex">military-industrial complex</a>". This is followed by a summary of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s years as president, emphasizing the events that, in Stone's thesis, would lead to his assassination. This builds to a reconstruction of the assassination on November 22, 1963. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">District Attorney</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison" title="Jim Garrison">Jim Garrison</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a>) subsequently learns about potential links to the assassination in New Orleans. Garrison and his team investigate several possible conspirators, including private pilot <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrie" title="David Ferrie">David Ferrie</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Pesci" title="Joe Pesci">Joe Pesci</a>), but are forced to let them go after their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government. Kennedy's suspected assassin <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Harvey_Oswald" title="Lee Harvey Oswald">Lee Harvey Oswald</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>) is killed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Ruby" title="Jack Ruby">Jack Ruby</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Doyle-Murray" title="Brian Doyle-Murray">Brian Doyle-Murray</a>) before he can go to trial, and Garrison closes the investigation.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The investigation is reopened in late 1966 after Garrison reads the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission" title="Warren Commission">Warren Report</a> and notices what he believes are numerous inaccuracies and conflicts. Garrison and his staff interrogate several witnesses to the Kennedy assassination, and others who were involved with Oswald, Ruby, and Ferrie. Upon Shaw's informal questioning, Shaw denies any knowledge of meeting Ferrie, O'Keefe or Oswald, but he is soon charged with conspiring to murder the President. Another witness is Willie O'Keefe (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Bacon" title="Kevin Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a>), a male prostitute serving five years in prison for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliciting" title="Soliciting">soliciting</a>, who reveals he witnessed Ferrie discussing Kennedy's assassination with Shaw, Oswald, and a group of Latin men. As well as briefly meeting Oswald, O'Keefe was romantically involved with a man he knew as "Clay Bertrand", who was Clay Shaw. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hill" title="Jean Hill">Jean Hill</a> (Ellen McElduff), a teacher who describes that she witnessed shots fired from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassy_knoll" title="Grassy knoll">grassy knoll</a> and she heard four to six shots total, tells the investigators that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a> threatened her into saying only three shots came from the book depository, revealing changes that were made to her testimony by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Commission" title="Warren Commission">Warren Commission</a>. Garrison and a staff member also go to the sniper's location in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository" title="Texas School Book Depository">Texas School Book Depository</a> and aim an empty rifle from the window through which Oswald was alleged to have shot Kennedy. They conclude that Oswald was too poor a marksman to make the shots, and two of the shots were much too close together, indicating that two additional assassins were also involved.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After discovering electronic surveillance microphones that had been planted in his offices, Garrison meets a high-level figure in Washington D.C. who identifies himself as "X" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>). "X" suggests there was a conspiracy at the highest levels of government, implicating members of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a>, the military-industrial complex, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">Mafia</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and Kennedy's vice-president, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_Baines_Johnson" title="Lyndon Baines Johnson">Lyndon Baines Johnson</a>, as either assassination pre-planning co-conspirators, or, as having motives to cover up the truth after the assassination. "X" explains the President was killed because of a more peaceful outlook in Kennedy's foreign policy which meant diminished profit for the military-industrial complex. It also enraged high-ranking military officials who viewed such diplomacy as weakness. Kennedy ordered control of secret para-military operations to be removed from the CIA and handed over to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">Department of Defense</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff" title="Joint Chiefs of Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>. This would have diminished the agency's power. Further, the Mafia had helped Kennedy win the 1960 election as a favor to his father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy,_Sr" title="Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr">Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr</a>, who had done business with the Mafia dating back to the 1920s, and felt betrayed that he had let his brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Kennedy" title="Bobby Kennedy">Bobby Kennedy</a>, continue his anti-Mob crusade instead of stopping it as he had promised. Furthermore, the Mob wanted revenge for the Bay of Pigs fiasco, which they had helped fund and support in order to get their Cuban casinosâ€”their biggest moneymakersâ€”back from the hands of the Castro government.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is clear who "Y" is in the film based on a partial glimpse of the name plate on his desk: General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lansdale" title="Edward Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a>, a real life figure who specialized in counter-insurgency. Lansdale established the CIA appartus in Vietnam. There is some evidence Lansdale was in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of Garrison's staff begin to doubt his motives and disagree with his methods, so they leave the investigation. Garrison's marriage is strained when his wife Liz (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sissy_Spacek" title="Sissy Spacek">Sissy Spacek</a>) complains that he is spending more time on the case than with his own family. After a sinister phone call is made to their daughter, Liz accuses Garrison of being selfish and attacking Shaw only because of his homosexuality. In addition, the media launches attacks on television and in newspapers attacking Garrison's character and criticizing the way his office is spending taxpayers' money. Some key witnesses become scared and refuse to testify while others, such as Ferrie, die in suspicious circumstances. Before his death, Ferrie tells Garrison that he believes people are after him, and reveals there was a conspiracy around Kennedy's death that involved co-conspirators that were involved in the CIA operation named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Project" title="Cuban Project">Operation Mongoose</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Clay_Shaw" title="Trial of Clay Shaw">trial of Clay Shaw</a> takes place in 1969. Garrison presents the court with further evidence of multiple killers while attempting to debunk the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_bullet_theory" title="Single bullet theory">single bullet theory</a>, proposes a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dealey_Plaza" title="Dealey Plaza">Dealey Plaza</a> shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots, but the jury acquits Shaw on all charges. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw died of lung cancer in 1974, but in 1979 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms" title="Richard Helms">Richard Helms</a> testified under oath that Clay Shaw had, in fact, been a part-time contract agent of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits state that secret records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.</p>

	<li>Kevin Costner stars as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison" title="Jim Garrison">Jim Garrison</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zachary Sklar, a journalist and a professor of journalism at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_School_of_Journalism" title="Columbia School of Journalism">Columbia School of Journalism</a>, met Jim Garrison in 1987 and helped him rewrite a manuscript that he was working on about the Kennedy assassination. He changed it from a scholarly book in the third person to "a detective storyâ€”a whydunit" in the first person. Sklar edited the book and it was published in 1988. While attending the Latin American Film Festival in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, Stone met Sheridan Square Press publisher Ellen Ray on an elevator. She had published Jim Garrison's book <i>On the Trail of the Assassins</i>. Ray had gone to New Orleans and worked with Garrison in 1967. She gave Stone a copy of Garrison's book and told him to read it. He did and quickly bought the film rights with $250,000 of his own money to prevent talk going around the studios about projects he might be developing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Kennedy Assassination had always had a profound effect on Stone: "The Kennedy murder was one of the signal events of the postwar generation, my generation". The filmmaker met Garrison and grilled him with a variety of questions for three hours. The man stood up to Stone's questioning and then got up and left. His <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris" title="Hubris">hubris</a> impressed the director. Stone's impressions from their meeting were that Garrison "made many mistakes. He trusted a lot of weirdos and followed a lot of fake leads. But he went out on a limb, way out. And he kept going, even when he knew he was facing long odds".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone was not interested in making a film about Garrison's life but rather the story behind the conspiracy to kill Kennedy. He also bought the film rights to <i>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Marrs" title="Jim Marrs">Jim Marrs</a>. One of the filmmaker's primary goals with <i>JFK</i> was to provide a rebuttal to the Warren Commission Report that he believed was "a great myth. And in order to fight a myth, maybe you have to create another one, a counter-myth". Even though Marrsâ€™ book collected many theories, Stone was hungry for more and hired Jane Rusconi, a recent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a> graduate, to head up a team of researchers and assemble as much information about the assassination as possible while the director completed post-production on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born_on_the_Fourth_of_July_(film)" title="Born on the Fourth of July (film)">Born on the Fourth of July</a></i>. Stone read two dozen books on the JFK assassination while Rusconi read between 100 to 200 books on the subject.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By December 1989, Stone began approaching studios to back his film. While in pre-production on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doors_(film)" title="The Doors (film)">The Doors</a></i>, he met with three executives at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> who wanted him to make a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>. However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> owned the rights and so Stone pitched <i>JFK</i>. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Semel" title="Terry Semel">Terry Semel</a> liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)" title="All the President's Men (film)">All the President's Men</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Parallax_View" title="The Parallax View">The Parallax View</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killing_Fields_(film)" title="The Killing Fields (film)">The Killing Fields</a></i>. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up 20 million dollars for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and he also knew that the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Stone set out to write the screenplay, he asked Sklar (who also edited Marrsâ€™ book) to co-write it with him and distill the Garrison book, the Marrs book and Rusconi's research into a script that would resemble what he called "a great detective movie". Stone told Sklar his vision of the film: "I see the models as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_(film)" title="Z (film)">Z</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_(film)" title="Rashomon (film)">Rashomon</a></i>, I see the event in Dealey Plaza taking place in the first reel, and again in the eighth reel, and again later, and each time we're going to see it differently and with more illumination". Although he did employ ideas from <i>Rashomon</i>, his principal model for <i>JFK</i> was <i>Z</i>: "Somehow I had the impression that in <i>Z</i> you had the showing of the crime and then the re-showing of the crime throughout the picture until it was seen another way. That was the idea of <i>JFK</i> â€“ that was the essence of it: basically, that's why I called it <i>JFK</i>. Not J dot F dot K dot. JFK. It was a code, like <i>Z</i> was a code, for he lives, American-style. As it was written it became more fascinating: it evolved into four DNA threads". Stone broke the structure of his film down into four stories: Garrison investigating the New Orleans connection to the Kennedy assassination; the research that revealed what Stone calls, "Oswald legend: who he was and how to try to inculcate that"; the recreation of the assassination at Dealey Plaza; and the information that the character of X imparts on Garrison, which Stone saw as the "means by which we were able to move between New Orleans, local, into the wider story of Dealey Plaza".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sklar worked on the Garrison side of the story while Stone added the Oswald story, the events at Dealey Plaza and the "Mr. X" character. Sklar spent a year researching and writing a 550 triple-spaced page screenplay and then Stone rewrote it and condensed it closer to normal screenplay length. Stone and Sklar used composite characters, most notably the "Mr. X" character played by Donald Sutherland. This was a technique that would be criticized in the press. He was a mix of Richard Case Nagell and retired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">Air Force</a> colonel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._Fletcher_Prouty" title="L. Fletcher Prouty">Fletcher Prouty</a>, another adviser for the film and who was a military liaison between the CIA and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">Pentagon</a>. Meeting Prouty was, for Stone, "one of the most extraordinary afternoons I've ever spent. Pretty much like in the movie, he just started to talk". According to Stone, "I feel this was in the spirit of the truth because Garrison also met a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Throat" title="Deep Throat">deep throat</a> type named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Case_Nagell" title="Richard Case Nagell">Richard Case Nagell</a>, who claimed to be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> agent and made Jim aware of a much larger scenario than the microcosm of New Orleans".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Early drafts of the screenplay suggested a four and a half-hour film with a potential budget of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>40 millionâ€”double what Stone had agreed to with Warner Bros. The director knew film mogul Arnon Milchan and met with him to help finance the film. Milchan was eager to work on the project and launch his new company, Regency Films, with a high profile film like <i>JFK</i>. Milchan made a deal with Warner Bros. to put up the money for the film. Stone managed to pare down his initial revision, a 190-page draft, to a 156-page shooting script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There were many advisers for the film, including Gerald Hemming, a former Marine who claimed involvement in various CIA activities, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Groden" title="Robert Groden">Robert Groden</a>, a photographic expert and longtime JFK assassination researcher and author.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story revolves around Costner's Jim Garrison, with a large cast of well-known stars in the supporting roles. Stone was inspired by the casting model of the documentary epic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Day_(film)" title="The Longest Day (film)">The Longest Day</a></i> which he had admired as a child: "It was realistic, but it had a lot of stars...the supporting cast provides a map of the American psyche: familiar, comfortable faces that walk you through a winding path in the dark woods".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Richardson_(cinematographer)" title="Robert Richardson (cinematographer)">Robert Richardson</a> was a week and a half into shooting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hope_(film)" title="City of Hope (film)">City of Hope</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sayles" title="John Sayles">John Sayles</a> when he got word that Stone was thinking about making <i>JFK</i>. By the time principal photography wrapped on <i>City of Hope</i>, Richardson was ready to make Stone's film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with <i>On the Trail of the Assassins</i> and <i>Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original idea was to film the opening sequence in 1.33:1 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> in order to simulate the TV screens that were available at the time of the assassination, then transition to 1.85:1 when Garrison began his investigation, and finally switch to 2.35:1 for scenes occurring in 1968 and later. However, because of time constraints and logistics, Richardson was forced to abandon this approach.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone wanted to recreate the Kennedy Assassination in Dealey Plaza. His producers had to pay the Dallas City Council a substantial amount of money to hire police to reroute traffic and close streets for three weeks. He only had ten days to shoot all of the footage he needed and so he used seven cameras (two 35Â mm and five 16Â mm) and 14 film stocks. Getting permission to shoot in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_School_Book_Depository" title="Texas School Book Depository">Texas School Book Depository</a> was more difficult. They had to pay fifty thousand dollars to put someone in the window that Lee Harvey Oswald was supposed to have shot Kennedy from. They were allowed to film in that location only between certain hours with only five people on the floor at one time: the camera crew, an actor, and Stone. Co-producer Clayton Townsend has said that the hardest part was getting the permission to restore the building to the way it looked back in 1963. It took five months of negotiation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The production spent four million to restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized a variety of film stocks. Richardson said, "It depends whether you want to shoot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film" title="35 mm film">35</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16_mm_film" title="16 mm film">16</a> or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_8_mm_film" title="Super 8 mm film">Super 8</a>. In many cases the lighting has to be different". For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras at the same time in different formats. Richardson said of Stone's style of direction, "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch". This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and relying very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>JFK</i> marked a fundamental change in the way that Stone constructed his films: a subjective lateral presentation of the plot, with the rhythm of the editing carrying the story. Stone brought in Hank Corwin, an editor of commercials, to help edit the film. Stone chose him because his "chaotic mind" was "totally alien to the film form". Stone remembers that Corwin irritated the more traditional editors working on the film because his "concepts are very commercial sixty-seconds-get-your-attention-fragment-your-mind-make-you-rethink-it. But he had not developed the long form yet. And so a lot of his cuts were very chaotic". Stone employed extensive use of flashbacks within flashbacks for a specific effect. He said in an interview, "I wanted to do the film on two or three levelsâ€”sound and picture would take us back, and we'd go from one flashback to another, and then that flashback would go inside another flashback...I wanted multiple layers because reading the Warren Commission Report is like drowning". This film was Stone's last one to use editing on film before he switched to digital editing. A setback occurred during editing that saw all the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_code" title="Time code">time codes</a> disappear.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Because of his enormous commitment to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, which opened the same month as <i>JFK</i>, composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> did not have time to compose a conventional score for the entire film. Instead he composed and conducted six musical sequences in full for <i>JFK</i> before he saw the entire film. Soon after recording this music, he traveled to New Orleans where Stone was still shooting the film and saw approximately an hour's worth of edited footage and some dailies. Williams remembers, "I thought his handling of Lee Harvey Oswald was particularly strong, and I understood some of the atmosphere of the film â€“ the sordid elements, the underside of New Orleans". Stone and his team then actually cut the film to fit Williams' music after the composer had scored and recorded musical cues in addition to the initial six he had done prior to seeing the film. For the Motorcade sequence, Williams described the score he composed as "strongly kinetic music, music of interlocking rhythmic disciplines". The composer remembered the moment he learned of the assassination of Kennedy and it stuck with him for years. This was a significant factor in his deciding to work on the film. Williams said, "This is a very resonant subject for people of my generation, and that's why I welcomed the opportunity to participate in this film".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On popular review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film holds a 82% rating, based on 52 reviews. However, the film's production and release was subject to intense scrutiny and criticism. A few weeks after shooting had begun, on May 14, 1991, Jon Margolis wrote in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> that <i>JFK</i> was "an insult to the intelligence". Five days later, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> ran a scathing article by national security correspondent George Lardner titled, "On the Set: Dallas in Wonderland" that used the first draft of the <i>JFK</i> screenplay to blast it for "the absurdities and palpable untruths in Garrison's book and Stone's rendition of it". The article pointed out that Garrison lost his case against Clay Shaw and that he inflated his case by trying to use Shaw's homosexual relationships to prove guilt by association. Stone responded to Lardner's article by hiring a public relations firm that specialized in political issues. Other critical articles soon followed. Anthony Lewis in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> stated that the film "tells us that our government cannot be trusted to give an honest account of a Presidential assassination". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> columnist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will" title="George Will">George Will</a> called Stone "a man of technical skill, scant education and negligible conscience".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine ran their own critique of the film-in-progress on June 10, 1991 and alleged that Stone was trying to suppress a rival JFK assassination film based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_DeLillo" title="Don DeLillo">Don DeLillo</a>'s 1988 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(novel)" title="Libra (novel)">Libra</a></i>. Stone rebutted these claims in a letter to the magazine. The filmmaker ended up splitting his time between making his film, responding to criticism, and conducting a publicity campaign of his own that saw him "omnipresent, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Evening_News" title="CBS Evening News">CBS Evening News</a></i>, to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show" title="The Oprah Winfrey Show">Oprah</a></i>". However, the Lardner <i>Post</i> piece stung the most because Lardner had stolen a copy of the script. Stone recalls, "He had the first draft, and I went through probably six or seven drafts".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the film was released in theaters, it polarized critics. The <i>New York Times</i> ran an article by Bernard Weinraub entitled, "Hollywood Wonders If Warner Brothers let <i>JFK</i> Go Too Far". The article called for intervention by the studio, asking "At what point does a studio exercise its leverage and blunt the highly charged message of a film maker like Oliver Stone?" The newspaper also ran a review of the film by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> who wrote, "Mr. Stone's hyperbolic style of film making is familiar: lots of short, often hysterical scenes tumbling one after another, backed by a soundtrack that is layered, strudel-like, with noises, dialogue, music, more noises, more dialogue". Veteran film critic for <i>The Washingtonian</i>, Pat Dowell had her 34-word capsule review for the January issue rejected by her editor John Limpert on the grounds that he did not want a positive review for a film he felt was "preposterous" associated with the magazine. Dowell resigned in protest.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald" title="Miami Herald">Miami Herald</a></i> said about the controversy in its review, "the focus on the trivialities of personality conveniently prevents us from having to confront the tough questions [Stone's] film raises". However, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised the film in his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i>, saying, "The achievement of the film is not that it answers the mystery of the Kennedy assassination, because it does not, or even that it vindicates Garrison, who is seen here as a man often whistling in the dark. Its achievement is that it tries to marshal the anger which ever since 1963 has been gnawing away on some dark shelf of the national psyche". Rita Kempley in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> wrote, "Quoting everyone from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare" title="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitler" title="Hitler">Hitler</a> to bolster their arguments, Stone and Sklar present a gripping alternative to the Warren Commission's conclusion.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On Christmas Day, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> ran a critical article entitled, "Suppression of the Facts Grants Stone a Broad Brush". <i>New York Newsday</i> followed suit the next day with two articles â€” "The Blurred Vision of <i>JFK</i>" and "The Many Theories of a Jolly Green Giant". A few days later, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> followed suit with "Stone's Film Trashes Facts, Dishonors J.F.K." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Valenti" title="Jack Valenti">Jack Valenti</a>, then president and chief executive of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">Motion Picture Association of America</a>, denounced Stone's film in a seven-page statement. He wrote, "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Reifenstahl" title="Leni Reifenstahl">Leni Reifenstahl</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triumph_of_the_Will" title="Triumph of the Will">Triumph of the Will</a></i>, in which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> was depicted as a newborn God. Both <i>J. F. K.</i> and <i>Triumph of the Will</i> are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax. Mr. Stone and Leni Reifenstahl have another genetic linkage: neither of them carried a disclaimer on their film that its contents were mostly pure fiction".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone recalls in an interview, "I can't even remember all the threats, there were so many of them". <i>Time</i> magazine ranked it the fourth best film of 1991. Roger Ebert went on to name Stone's film as the best film of the year and one of the top ten films of the decade. The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" title="Sydney Morning Herald">Sydney Morning Herald</a></i> named <i>JFK</i> as the best film of 1991. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> ranked it the 5th Most Controversial Movie Ever.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Years after its release, Stone said of the film that it "was the beginning of a new era for me in terms of film making because it's not just about a conspiracy to kill John Kennedy. It's also about the way we look at our recent history...It shifts from black and white to color, and then back again, and views people from offbeat angles".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reclaiming_History" title="Reclaiming History">Reclaiming History</a></i>, a history of the Kennedy assassination published 16 years after the release of <i>JFK</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Bugliosi" title="Vincent Bugliosi">Vincent Bugliosi</a> devoted an entire chapter to Jim Garrison's prosecution of Clay Shaw and Oliver Stone's subsequent film. Bugliosi lists thirty-two separate "lies and fabrications" in Stone's movie and describes the film as "one continuous lie in which Stone couldn't find any level of deception and invention beyond which he was unwilling to go."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>JFK</i> was released in theaters on December 20, 1991. The box office for the film started slow but picked up momentum and by the first week in January 1992, it had grossed over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USD" title="USD">$</a>50 million worldwide. Stone started to get support for his film. Warner Brothers executives pointed out that because of the film's long running time, it had fewer screenings. The studio undertook a $15 million marketing campaign promoting Stone's film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On its first week of release, <i>JFK</i> tied with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_and_the_Beast_(1991_film)" title="Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)">Beauty and the Beast</a></i> for fifth place in the U.S. box office and its critics began to say it was a flop. However, <i>JFK</i> eventually earned over $205 million worldwide, and $70 million in the United States during its initial run. Garrison's estate subsequently sued <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> for a share of the film's profits, alleging a book-keeping practice known as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting" title="Hollywood accounting">Hollywood accounting</a>".
