      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Robert John Downey, Jr.</b> (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey made his screen debut in 1970, at the age of five, when he appeared in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey,_Sr." title="Robert Downey, Sr.">his father</a>'s film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_(film)" title="Pound (film)">Pound</a></i>, and has worked consistently in film and television ever since. During the 1980s he had roles in a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age" title="Coming of age">coming of age</a> films associated with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack_(actors)" title="Brat Pack (actors)">Brat Pack</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(film)" title="Less Than Zero (film)">Less Than Zero</a></i> (1987) is particularly notable, not only because it was the first time Downey's acting would be acknowledged by critics, but also because the role pushed Downey's already existing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_habit" title="Drug habit">drug habit</a> one step further. After <i>Zero</i>, Downey started landing roles in bigger films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(film)" title="Air America (film)">Air America</a></i> (1990), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapdish" title="Soapdish">Soapdish</a></i> (1991) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Born_Killers" title="Natural Born Killers">Natural Born Killers</a></i> (1994). These higher-profile roles eventually led to his being cast as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> in the 1992 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaplin_(film)" title="Chaplin (film)">Chaplin</a></i>, for which he earned an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1996 and 2001, Downey was frequently arrested on drug-related charges and went through several drug treatment programs, but had difficulty staying clean. After being released from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Substance_Abuse_Treatment_Facility_and_State_Prison" title="California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison">California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison</a> in 2000, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_McBeal" title="Ally McBeal">Ally McBeal</a></i>, playing the new love interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calista_Flockhart" title="Calista Flockhart">Calista Flockhart</a>'s title character.

After one last stay in a court-ordered drug treatment program, Downey finally achieved lasting sobriety and his career began to take off again. He appeared in semi-independent films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singing_Detective_(film)" title="The Singing Detective (film)">The Singing Detective</a></i> (2003), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Kiss_Bang_Bang" title="Kiss Kiss Bang Bang">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></i> (2005), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scanner_Darkly_(film)" title="A Scanner Darkly (film)">A Scanner Darkly</a></i> (2006).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2007, Downey was cast as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" title="Iron Man">title character</a> in the comic book adaptation <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man</a></i> which premiered in the spring of 2008, making almost $100 million in the United States and Canada during its opening weekend. In addition to receiving commercial success, Downey's performance in the film received rave reviews.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey had minor roles in his father's projects in his childhood.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey began building upon theater roles, including short-lived off-Broadway musical "American Passion" at the Joyce Theater in 1983, produced by Norman Lear. In 1985, at age 20, Downey joined the cast of the weekly television comedy show <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> (<i>SNL</i>), but was fired in 1986 following a cast overhaul that was done in order to save the show from cancellation due to low Nielsen ratings and critics panning the show for its mediocre cast at the time. Downey had his breakthrough when in 1985 he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Spader" title="James Spader">James Spader</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidekick" title="Sidekick">sidekick</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff_Turf" title="Tuff Turf">Tuff Turf</a></i> and then a bully in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(film_director)" title="John Hughes (film director)">John Hughes</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Science_(film)" title="Weird Science (film)">Weird Science</a></i>. He was considered for the role of Duckie in John Hughes' film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_in_Pink" title="Pretty in Pink">Pretty in Pink</a></i> (1986), but his first lead role would be with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molly_Ringwald" title="Molly Ringwald">Molly Ringwald</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pick-up_Artist_(film)" title="The Pick-up Artist (film)">The Pick-up Artist</a></i> (1987). Because of these and other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_of_age" title="Coming of age">coming of age</a> films Downey did during the 1980s, he is sometimes named as a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brat_Pack_(actors)" title="Brat Pack (actors)">Brat Pack</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1987, Downey played Julian Wells, a drug-addicted rich boy whose life rapidly spirals out of his control, in the film version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bret_Easton_Ellis" title="Bret Easton Ellis">Bret Easton Ellis</a> novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_Than_Zero_(film)" title="Less Than Zero (film)">Less Than Zero</a></i>. His performance, described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin" title="Janet Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> in <i>The New York Times</i> as "desperately moving", was widely praised, though Downey has said that for him "the role was like the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Christmas_Yet_to_Come" title="Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come">ghost of Christmas Future</a>" since his drug habit resulted in him becoming an "exaggeration of the character" in real life. <i>Zero</i> drove Downey into films with bigger budgets and names, such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chances_Are_(film)" title="Chances Are (film)">Chances Are</a></i> (1989) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybill_Shepherd" title="Cybill Shepherd">Cybill Shepherd</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_O%27Neal" title="Ryan O'Neal">Ryan O'Neal</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(film)" title="Air America (film)">Air America</a></i> (1990) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapdish" title="Soapdish">Soapdish</a></i> (1991) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Field" title="Sally Field">Sally Field</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Kline" title="Kevin Kline">Kevin Kline</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>.</p>

He even had a personal coach in order to imitate Chaplin's posture and way of carrying himself. The role garnered Downey an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65th_Academy_Awards" title="65th Academy Awards">Academy Awards 65th ceremony</a>, losing to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scent_of_a_Woman" title="Scent of a Woman">Scent of a Woman</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1996 through 2003, Downey was arrested numerous times on drug-related charges and went several times through drug treatment programs unsuccessfully, explaining in 1999 to a judge: "It's like I have a loaded gun in my mouth and my finger's on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gunmetal." He also explained his relapses by claiming to be addicted to drugs since the age of eight; his father was giving them to him as he was also an addict.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 1996, Downey was arrested for possession of heroin, cocaine and an unloaded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.357_Magnum" title=".357 Magnum">.357-caliber Magnum</a> handgun, while he was speeding down <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Boulevard" title="Sunset Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a>. A month later, when on parole, he trespassed into a neighbor's home while under the influence of a controlled substance, falling asleep in one of the beds. He was sentenced to three years of probation and required to undergo mandatory drug testing. In 1997 he missed one of the court-ordered drug tests and had to spend four months in the Los Angeles County jail. When Downey missed another required drug test in 1999, he was arrested once more. Despite Downey's lawyer, John Stewart Holden, assembling for his client's 1999 defense the same team of lawyers that successfully defended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson" title="O. J. Simpson">O. J. Simpson</a> during his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O._J._Simpson_murder_case" title="O. J.

"Corcoran II"). At the time of the 1999 arrest, all of Downey's film projects had wrapped and were close to release, with the exception of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dreams_(film)" title="In Dreams (film)">In Dreams</a></i>, which he was allowed to complete filming. He had also been hired for voicing "The Devil" on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> animated television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God,_the_Devil_and_Bob" title="God, the Devil and Bob">God, the Devil and Bob</a></i>, but was fired when he failed to show up for rehearsals.</p>

A week after his 2000 release, Downey joined the cast of the hit television series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ally_McBeal" title="Ally McBeal">Ally McBeal</a></i>, playing the new love interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calista_Flockhart" title="Calista Flockhart">Calista Flockhart</a>'s title character.

Despite the apparent success, Downey claims that his performance on the series was overrated and that "It was my lowest point in terms of addictions. At that stage, I didn't give a fuck whether I ever acted again." In January 2001, Downey was scheduled to play the role of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i> in a Los Angeles stage production directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the end of his first season on <i>Ally McBeal</i>, Downey was arrested during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> 2000, when his room at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv_Griffin" title="Merv Griffin">Merv Griffin</a>'s Hotel and Givenchy Spa in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs,_California" title="Palm Springs, California">Palm Springs, California</a> was searched by the police who were responding to an anonymous 911 call. Downey was under the influence of a controlled substance and in possession of cocaine and valium. Despite the fact that if convicted he could face a prison sentence of up to four years and eight months, he signed on to appear in at least eight more <i>Ally McBeal</i> episodes. In April 2001, while he was on parole, a Los Angeles police officer found him wandering barefoot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culver_City" title="Culver City">Culver City</a>, near southwest Los Angeles. He was arrested for suspicion of being under the influence of drugs but was released a few hours later, even though tests showed he had cocaine in his system. After this last arrest, producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_E._Kelley" title="David E. Kelley">David E. Kelley</a> and other <i>Ally McBeal</i> executives ordered last-minute re-writes and re-shoots and dismissed Downey from the show, despite the fact that Downey's character had resuscitated <i>Ally McBeal'</i>s ratings. The Culver City arrest also cost him a role in the high-profile film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America%27s_Sweethearts" title="America's Sweethearts">America's Sweethearts</a></i>, and the subsequent incarceration forced Mel Gibson to shut down his planned stage production of <i>Hamlet</i> as well. In July 2001, Downey pleaded no contest to the Palm Springs charges, avoiding jail time; instead, he was sent into drug rehabilitation and put on a three-year probation, benefiting from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_36_(2000)" title="California Proposition 36 (2000)">California Proposition 36</a>, which had been passed the year before with the aim of helping non-violent drug offenders overcome their addictions instead of sending them to jail.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The book <i>Conversations with Woody Allen</i> reports that director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a> wanted to cast Downey and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winona_Ryder" title="Winona Ryder">Winona Ryder</a> in his film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_and_Melinda" title="Melinda and Melinda">Melinda and Melinda</a></i> in 2005, but was unable to do so because he could not get insurance on them, stating, "We couldn't get bonded. The completion bonding companies would not bond the picture unless we could insure them. We were heartbroken because I had worked with Winona before [on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(film)" title="Celebrity (film)">Celebrity</a></i>] and thought she was perfect for this and wanted to work with her again. And I had always wanted to work with Bob Downey and always thought he was a huge talent."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a December 18, 2000 article for <i>People</i> Magazine entitled "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey had been diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder" title="Bipolar disorder">bipolar disorder</a> "a few years ago" and added that his bipolar disorder was "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of <i>Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth</i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:BookSources/978-1883819576" title="Special:BookSources/978-1883819576">ISBN-13: 978-1883819576</a>), says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Substance_Abuse_Treatment_Facility_and_State_Prison" title="California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison">Corcoran II</a>, asking for advice on his condition; she discovered that "no one had done a complete [psychiatric] evaluation [on him]...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times I spend a lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" In an article for the March 2007 issue of <i>Esquire</i> Magazine, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address "this whole thing about the bipolar" after receiving a phone call from "the Bipolar Association" asking him about being bipolar; when Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the <i>People</i> article, to which Downey replied, "'No! <i>Dr. Malibusian</i> said [I said I was bipolar]...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" Downey flatly denied being "depressed or manic" and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After five years of substance abuse, arrest, rehab, and relapse, Robert Downey, Jr. was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs and a return to his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a> in November 2004 that "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration, such as court-ordered rehab, "I finally said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I reached out for help, and I ran with it.... You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way, and you'll get it, and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to actually do it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey got his first post-rehab acting job in August 2001, lip-syncing in the video for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_John" title="Elton John">Elton John</a>'s single "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Songs_from_the_West_Coast" title="Songs from the West Coast">I Want Love</a>". Video director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Taylor-Wood" title="Sam Taylor-Wood">Sam Taylor-Wood</a> shot 16 takes of the video and used the last one because, according to John, Downey looked completely relaxed, and "the way he underplays it is fantastic."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey was able to return to the big screen only after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, who had been a close friend to Downey since both had co-starred in <i>Air America</i>, paid Downey's insurance bond for the 2003 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singing_Detective_(film)" title="The Singing Detective (film)">The Singing Detective</a></i>. Gibson's gamble paved the way for Downey's comeback, and Downey returned to mainstream films in the mid 2000s with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothika" title="Gothika">Gothika</a></i>, for which producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver" title="Joel Silver">Joel Silver</a> withheld 40 percent of his salary until after production wrapped as insurance against his addictive behavior; similar clauses have become standard in his contracts since then.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Gothika</i>, Downey was cast in a number of leading and supporting roles, including well-received work in a number of semi-independent films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_to_Recognizing_Your_Saints" title="A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Night,_and_Good_Luck" title="Good Night, and Good Luck">Good Night, and Good Luck</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Scanner_Darkly_(film)" title="A Scanner Darkly (film)">A Scanner Darkly</a></i>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Shainberg" title="Steven Shainberg">Steven Shainberg</a>'s fictional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopic" title="Biopic">biopic</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Arbus" title="Diane Arbus">Diane Arbus</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_(film)" title="Fur (film)">Fur</a></i>, where Downey's character represented the two biggest influences on Arbus' professional life, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisette_Model" title="Lisette Model">Lisette Model</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Israel" title="Marvin Israel">Marvin Israel</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On November 23, 2004, Downey released his debut musical album, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Futurist_(Robert_Downey_Jr._album)" title="The Futurist (Robert Downey Jr. album)">The Futurist</a></i>, on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Classical" title="Sony Classical">Sony Classical</a>, for which he designed the cover art and designed the track listing label on the CD with his son Indio. The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album as he felt that the energy he put in doing the album was not compensated.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, Downey returned to his television roots when he guest-starred on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> in the episode "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fat_Guy_Strangler" title="The Fat Guy Strangler">The Fat Guy Strangler</a>". Downey had previously telephoned the show's production staff and asked if he could produce or assist in an episode creation, as his son is a fan of the show.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey signed on with publishers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarperCollins" title="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a> to write a memoir, which in 2006 was already being billed as a "candid look at the highs and lows of his life and career". In 2008, however, Downey returned his advance to the publishers and cancelled the book without further comment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With all of the critical success Robert Downey, Jr. had experienced throughout his career, he had never appeared in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)" title="Blockbuster (entertainment)">"blockbuster" film</a>. That changed in the summer of 2008, when Downey starred in two critically and commercially successful films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_Thunder" title="Tropic Thunder">Tropic Thunder</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2007, Downey was cast as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man" title="Iron Man">title character</a> in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man</a></i>, with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Favreau" title="Jon Favreau">Jon Favreau</a> explaining the choice by stating: "Downey, Jr., wasn't the most obvious choice but he understood what makes the character tick. He found a lot of his own life experience in 'Tony Stark'." Favreau insisted in having Downey as he repeatedly claimed that Downey would be to <i>Iron Man</i> what <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a> is to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_(film_series)" title="Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)"><i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> trilogy</a>, a lead actor that could both elevate the quality of the film and increase the public's interest in it. For the role Downey had to gain more than 20 pounds of muscle in five months so as to look like he "had the power to forge iron."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(film)" title="Iron Man (film)">Iron Man</a></i> was globally released between April 30 and May 3, 2008, grossing over $300 million in the United States and Canada and receiving rave reviews which cite Downey's performance as a highlight of the film. As a result, both Downey and Favreau stated their interest in making <i>Iron Man</i> a trilogy. By October 2008, Downey had agreed to appear as Iron Man in two <i>Iron Man</i> sequels and the future film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">The Avengers</a></i>, named after the superhero team that Stark joins.

Each man plays a Hollywood archetypeâ€”self-absorbed multi-Oscar winning Aussie method actor Kirk Lazarus (Downey), aging action hero desperately looking to reinvent himself as a serious actor (Stiller), and overweight heroin-addicted self-destructive comic best known for portraying multiple characters in a franchise of comedies about a family that farts in every film (Black)â€”as they star in an extremely expensive Vietnam-era movie called <i>Tropic Thunder</i>. Lazarus undergoes a "controversial skin pigmentation procedure" in order to take on the role of African-American platoon sergeant Lincoln Osiris, which required Downey to wear dark makeup and a wig. Both Stiller and Downey feared Downey's portrayal of the character could become controversial:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When asked by Harry Smith on CBS's <i>The Early Show</i> who his model was for Lazarus, Downey laughed before responding, "Sadly, my sorry-ass self."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Released in the United States on August 13, 2008, <i>Tropic Thunder</i> received generally good reviews with 83% of reviews positive and an average normalized score of 71, according to the review aggregator websites <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, respectively.

The film grossed $180Â million in theaters before its release on home video on NovemberÂ 18, 2008.

Downey still picked up an Academy Award nomination for the 2008 release year for his role in <i>Tropic Thunder</i>, but did not gain similar recognition for <i>The Soloist</i> after its delayed release.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On June 14, 2010, Robert Downey, Jr. and his wife Susan, opened their own production company called Team Downey.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey started dating actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jessica_Parker" title="Sarah Jessica Parker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> after meeting her on the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firstborn_(film)" title="Firstborn (film)">Firstborn</a></i>. They separated in 1991 because of his drug and alcohol abuse, according to Downey. He married actress/singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Falconer" title="Deborah Falconer">Deborah Falconer</a> on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship, and had a son with her, Indio Falconer Downey, born on September 7, 1993 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County,_California" title="Los Angeles County, California">Los Angeles County, California</a>. The strain on their marriage from Downey's repeated trips to rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in the midst of Downey's last arrest and sentence to an extended stay in rehab, Falconer left Downey in 2001 and took Indio with her. Downey and Falconer finalized their divorce on April 26, 2004.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With his parents' guidance, Indio Falconer Downey began developing his own show-business career before he had even reached his teens. His first professional work was an appearance in one of his father's movies, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Kiss_Bang_Bang" title="Kiss Kiss Bang Bang">Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</a></i>, playing a younger version of his father's character Harry Lockhart. Following his mother's musical lead, Indio has branched out into a musical career as lead guitarist for a rock band, The Jack Bambis, whose members are all under the age of 18. Downey now sees his son frequently after settling custody arrangements with Falconer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, on the set of <i>Gothika</i>, Downey met producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Downey" title="Susan Downey">Susan Levin</a>, an Executive Vice President of Production at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Silver" title="Joel Silver">Joel Silver</a>'s movie company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Pictures" title="Silver Pictures">Silver Pictures</a>. Downey and Susan quietly struck up a romance during production, though Susan turned down his romantic advances twice. Despite Susan's worries that the romance would not last after the completion of shooting because "he's an actor; I have a real job", the couple's relationship continued after production wrapped on <i>Gothika</i>, and Downey proposed to Susan on the night before her thirtieth birthday. The couple were married on August 27, 2005, in a Jewish ceremony at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amagansett,_New_York" title="Amagansett, New York">Amagansett, New York</a>. He credits his wife with helping him kick his drug and alcohol habits."There's no understanding for me of the bigger picture in real time in a hands-on way without her. Because it was the perfect, perfect, perfect matching of personalities and gifts." One of his biceps reads "Suzie Q" in tribute to her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey says he has been drug-free since July 2003, thanks to his family, therapy, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_meditation" title="Buddhist meditation">meditation</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-step_program" title="Twelve-step program">twelve-step recovery programs</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a> and the practice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun" title="Wing Chun">Wing Chun</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu" title="Kung Fu">Kung Fu</a>.

On the same panel, Downey described how he worked long hours and many weekends to ensure the accuracy of his portrayal of Holmes so as to help make the film a success.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey has been a close friend of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> since they starred in <i>Air America</i>. Downey defended Gibson during the controversy surrounding <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Passion_of_the_Christ" title="The Passion of the Christ">The Passion of the Christ</a></i>, and said "nobody's perfect" in reference to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson_DUI_incident" title="Mel Gibson DUI incident">Gibson's DUI</a>. Said Gibson of Downey:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Downey has indicated that his time in prison changed his political point of view somewhat, saying: â€œI have a really interesting political point of view, and itâ€™s not always something I say too loud at dinner tables here, but you canâ€™t go from a $2,000-a-night suite at La Mirage to a penitentiary and really understand it and come out a liberal. You canâ€™t. I wouldnâ€™t wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since.â€&#157; In a 2007 interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_magazine" title="W magazine">W magazine</a> Downey showed the journalist a photograph of himself and his wife with then President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W.
