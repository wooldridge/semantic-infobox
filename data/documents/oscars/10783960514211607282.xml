      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacino was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Harlem" title="East Harlem">East Harlem</a>, New York City, the son of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_American" title="Italian American">Italian American</a> parents Rose (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Gerardi) and Salvatore Alfred Pacino, who divorced when he was two years old. When he was two, his mother moved to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Bronx" title="South Bronx">South Bronx</a> near the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronx_Zoo" title="Bronx Zoo">Bronx Zoo</a>, to live with her parents, Kate and James Gerardi, who originated from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corleone" title="Corleone">Corleone</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>. His father moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covina,_California" title="Covina, California">Covina</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, and worked as an insurance salesman and restaurateur. Pacino attended a school officially named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School_of_Performing_Arts" title="High School of Performing Arts">High School of Performing Arts</a>, a division of the Fiorello H. La Guardia High School of Music and the Arts in New York City, the main school of which was attended by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godfather_II" title="Godfather II">Godfather II</a></i> costar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a>. During his teenage years 'Sonny', as he was known to his friends, aimed to become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball" title="Baseball">baseball</a> player, though he was also nicknamed 'The Actor'. Pacino flunked nearly all of his classes except <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_studies" title="English studies">English</a> and dropped out of school at 17. His mother disagreed with his decision; they had an argument and he left home. He worked at a string of low-paying jobs, including messenger boy, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busboy" title="Busboy">busboy</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor" title="Janitor">janitor</a>, and postal clerk, in order to finance his acting studies.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He started <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">smoking</a> at age nine and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol" title="Alcohol">drinking</a> and casual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana" title="Marijuana">marijuana</a> use at age thirteen, but never took hard drugs. His two closest friends died young of drug abuse, at the ages of 19 and 30 (his friend who died at age 30 had not seen Pacino for some years before he died). Growing up in a deprived area, he got into occasional fights, and was something of a minor troublemaker at school.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He acted in basement plays in New York's theatrical underground, and then joined the Herbert Berghof Studio (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HB_Studio" title="HB Studio">HB Studio</a>), where he met acting teacher Charlie Laughton, who became his mentor and best friend. During this period, he was frequently unemployed and homeless, and sometimes had to sleep on the street, in theaters or at friends' houses. In 1962, his mother died aged 43. The following year, his grandfather, James Gerardi, one of the most influential people in his life, also died.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Film_career">Film career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacino found acting to be enjoyable and realized he had a gift for it while studying at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actors_Studio" title="Actors Studio">Actors' Studio</a> (<a href="#Acting_background">see below</a>). However, his early work was not financially rewarding. After success on stage (<a href="#Stage_career">see below</a>), Pacino made his movie debut with a brief screen appearance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me,_Natalie" title="Me, Natalie">Me, Natalie</a></i>, an independent film starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Duke" title="Patty Duke">Patty Duke</a>, released July 1969. In 1970, Pacino signed with the talent agency Creative Management Associates (CMA).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was the 1971 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Panic_in_Needle_Park" title="The Panic in Needle Park">The Panic in Needle Park</a></i>, in which he played a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin" title="Heroin">heroin</a> addict, that brought Pacino to the attention of director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, who cast him as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael Corleone</a> in the blockbuster 1972 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>. Although several established actors â€“ including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>, and a little-known <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro" title="Robert De Niro">Robert De Niro</a> â€“ also wanted to portray Michael Corleone, Coppola selected the relatively unknown Pacino, much to the dismay of studio executives. He was even teased on the set because he was short in height. Pacino's performance earned him an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> nomination, and offered a prime example of his early acting style, described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliwell%27s_Film_Guide" title="Halliwell's Film Guide">Halliwell's Film Guide</a> as "intense" and "tightly clenched". However Pacino boycotted the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/45th_Academy_Awards" title="45th Academy Awards">45th Academy Awards</a> as he was insulted at being nominated for the Supporting Acting award, noting that he had more screen time than Brando â€“ who was himself boycotting the awards.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1973, he co-starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarecrow_(1973_film)" title="Scarecrow (1973 film)">Scarecrow</a></i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>, and won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. That same year, Pacino starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serpico" title="Serpico">Serpico</a></i>, based on the true story of New York City policeman Frank Serpico, who went undercover to expose the corruption of fellow officers. In 1974, Pacino reprised his role as Michael Corleone in the sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_II" title="The Godfather Part II">The Godfather Part II</a></i>, acclaimed as being comparable to the original. The film became the first sequel to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture Oscar</a>, and Pacino was nominated for his third Oscar. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a> magazine declared that his performance in the film "is arguably cinema's greatest portrayal of the hardening of a heart". In 1975, he enjoyed further success with the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_Day_Afternoon" title="Dog Day Afternoon">Dog Day Afternoon</a></i>, based on the true story of bank robber <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wojtowicz" title="John Wojtowicz">John Wojtowicz</a>. It was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Lumet" title="Sidney Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>, who also directed him in <i>Serpico</i> a few years earlier, and for both films Pacino was nominated for Best Actor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, Pacino starred as a race-car driver in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Deerfield" title="Bobby Deerfield">Bobby Deerfield</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Pollack" title="Sydney Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a>, and received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> nomination for Best Motion Picture ActorÂ â€“ Drama for his portrayal of the title role, losing out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>, who won for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(film)" title="Equus (film)">Equus</a></i>. His next film was the dark drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And_Justice_for_All_(film)" title="...And Justice for All (film)">...And Justice for All</a></i>, which again saw Pacino lauded by critics for his wide range of acting abilities, and nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for a fourth time. However he lost out that year to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kramer_vs._Kramer" title="Kramer vs. Kramer">Kramer vs. Kramer</a></i>â€” a role that Pacino had declined.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1970s, Pacino had four Oscar nominations for Best Actor, for his performances in <i>Serpico</i>, <i>The Godfather Part II</i>, <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>, and <i>...And Justice for All</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacino's career slumped in the early 1980s; his appearances in the controversial <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruising_(film)" title="Cruising (film)">Cruising</a></i>, a film which provoked protests from New York's gay community, and the comedy-drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author!_Author!_(film)" title="Author! Author! (film)">Author! Author!</a></i> were critically panned. However, 1983's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarface_(1983_film)" title="Scarface (1983 film)">Scarface</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a>, proved to be a career highlight and a defining role. Upon its initial release, the film was critically panned, but did well at the box office, grossing over US$45 million domestically. Pacino earned a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe</a> nomination for his role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuban</a> drug lord <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Montana" title="Tony Montana">Tony Montana</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1985, Pacino worked on his personal project, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Local_Stigmatic" title="The Local Stigmatic">The Local Stigmatic</a></i>, a 1969 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off_Broadway" title="Off Broadway">Off Broadway</a> play by the English writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathcote_Williams" title="Heathcote Williams">Heathcote Williams</a>. He starred in the play, remounting it with director David Wheeler and the Theater Company of Boston in a 50-minute film version. The film was never released theatrically but was later released as part of the <i>Pacino: An Actor's Vision</i> box set in 2007.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His 1985 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolution_(1985_film)" title="Revolution (1985 film)">Revolution</a></i> about a fur trapper during the American Revolutionary War, was a commercial and critical failure, which Pacino blamed on a rushed production, resulting in a four-year hiatus from films. During this time Pacino returned to the stage. He mounted workshop productions of <i>Crystal Clear</i>, <i>National Anthems</i> and other plays; he appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a></i> in 1988 in producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Papp" title="Joseph Papp">Joseph Papp</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Shakespeare_Festival" title="New York Shakespeare Festival">New York Shakespeare Festival</a>. Pacino remarked on his hiatus from film: "I remember back when everything was happening, '74, '75, doing <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Resistible_Rise_of_Arturo_Ui" title="The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui">The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui</a></i> on stage and reading that the reason I'd gone back to the stage was that my movie career was waning! That's been the kind of ethos, the way in which theater's perceived, unfortunately." Pacino returned to film in 1989's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_of_Love_(film)" title="Sea of Love (film)">Sea of Love</a></i>, about a detective played by Pacino who is trying to catch a serial killer who finds victims through the singles column in a newspaper. The film earned solid reviews.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacino received an Academy Award nomination for playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Boy_Caprice" title="Big Boy Caprice">Big Boy Caprice</a> in the box office hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Tracy_(1990_film)" title="Dick Tracy (1990 film)">Dick Tracy</a></i> in 1990, in which critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote that Pacino is â€˜the scene-stealerâ€™. Later in the year he followed this up by a return to one of his most famous characters, Michael Corleone, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Part_III" title="The Godfather Part III">The Godfather Part III</a></i> (1990). The film had a good reception, but the third instalment had problems during pre production due to script rewrites and the withdrawal of actors shortly before production. In 1991, Pacino starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_and_Johnny_(1991_film)" title="Frankie and Johnny (1991 film)">Frankie and Johnny</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>, who co-starred with Pacino in <i>Scarface</i>. The film is about a recently released prisoner (Pacino) who begins a relationship with a waitress (Pfeiffer) in the diner he works in. It was adapted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_McNally" title="Terrence McNally">Terrence McNally</a> from his own Off-Broadway play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_and_Johnny_in_the_Clair_de_Lune" title="Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune">Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune</a></i> (1987), which featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Welsh" title="Kenneth Welsh">Kenneth Welsh</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Bates" title="Kathy Bates">Kathy Bates</a>. The film received mainly positive reviews with Janet Maslin in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> writing, "Mr. Pacino has not been this uncomplicatedly appealing since his "Dog Day Afternoon" days, and he makes Johnny's endless enterprise in wooing Frankie a delight. His scenes alone with Ms. Pfeiffer have a precision and honesty that keep the film's maudlin aspects at bay."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charlie Simms (Chris O'Donnell), a student at an exclusive New England <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University-preparatory_school#United_States_and_Canada" title="University-preparatory school">prep school</a>, is one of the few students there from a modest background and attends on scholarship. To pay for his flight home to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gresham,_Oregon" title="Gresham, Oregon">Gresham, Oregon</a> for Christmas, Charlie takes a job over Thanksgiving looking after a retired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers" title="United States Army Rangers">Army Ranger</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_Colonel" title="Lieutenant Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> named Frank Slade (Al Pacino), who is disagreeable, blind, and an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charlie and his "friend" George Willis, Jr. (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Seymour_Hoffman" title="Philip Seymour Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>) were witness to an act of vandalism at the school. They are pressed by the school's headmaster Trask (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Rebhorn" title="James Rebhorn">James Rebhorn</a>) to divulge the names of the perpetrators, whom they both know. When Charlie refuses to talk, Trask offers a bribe: a letter of recommendation that would virtually guarantee his acceptance to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard</a>. Charlie continues to remain silent but begins to question his decision.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shortly after Charlie arrives, Slade unexpectedly has Charlie accompany him on a trip from New England to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Slade reserves a room at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria" title="Waldorf-Astoria">Waldorf-Astoria</a>.

Charlie is taken aback, not knowing how seriously to take Slade.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">They travel to Slade's brother's home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Plains,_New_York" title="White Plains, New York">White Plains</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving" title="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> dinner without advising the brother of the visit. Slade and Charlie appear to be an unpleasant surprise for the family. Slade deliberately provokes everyone, and by the end of dinner (he puts his nephew in a chokehold after he insults Charlie), he succeeds in alienating the members of his family. Charlie learns from Slade's nephew, Randy, that Slade lost his sight by juggling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_grenade" title="Hand grenade">hand grenades</a> while drunk and one went off.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As they return to New York, Charlie tells Slade about his complications at school. Slade advises Charlie to inform on his classmates and go to Harvard, warning him that Willis will probably be pressured into not maintaining silence. Later at a restaurant, Charlie and Slade observe Donna (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabrielle_Anwar" title="Gabrielle Anwar">Gabrielle Anwar</a>), a beautiful young woman waiting for her date. Although blind, Slade leads Donna in a spectacular <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango_(dance)" title="Tango (dance)">tango</a> on the dance floor. That night, he hires a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_girl" title="Call girl">call girl</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Deeply despondent the next morning, Slade responds to Charlie's suggestion that they test drive a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_Mondial" title="Ferrari Mondial">Ferrari</a>. Charlie lets Slade drive the car, which he does at high speed, until they are stopped by a policeman (then-unknown <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Eldard" title="Ron Eldard">Ron Eldard</a>.) Slade hides the fact that he is blind and the officer issues no citation. When they return to the hotel, Slade tricks Charlie into leaving the room to buy him <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigars" title="Cigars">cigars</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin" title="Aspirin">aspirin</a>. Charlie returns to find Slade preparing to shoot himself. Charlie intervenes, grabbing the gun just before Slade can pull the trigger. After a physical struggle and argument, Slade lets go. He confides in Charlie, particularly about his dream of finding a woman who would love him.</p>
