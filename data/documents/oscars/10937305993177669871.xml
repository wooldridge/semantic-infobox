The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> is on and Tsar Nicholas (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jayston" title="Michael Jayston">Michael Jayston</a>) is warned by Count Witte (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>) and Grand Duke Nicholas (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Andrews" title="Harry Andrews">Harry Andrews</a>) that the war is futile and costing too many lives. They also tell him that the Russian people want a representative government, health care, voting and workers' rights, but Nicholas wants to maintain the traditional autocracy left to him by his forefathers. Meanwhile, underground political parties led by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenin" title="Lenin">Lenin</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bryant_(actor)" title="Michael Bryant (actor)">Michael Bryant</a>), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin" title="Stalin">Stalin</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hazeldine" title="James Hazeldine">James Hazeldine</a>), and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trotsky" title="Trotsky">Trotsky</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)" title="Brian Cox (actor)">Brian Cox</a>) have formed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alexei is soon diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemophilia" title="Hemophilia">hemophilia</a>. The Tsarina Alexandra (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Suzman" title="Janet Suzman">Janet Suzman</a>) is frantic. A shy former German princess who is not highly thought of by the Russian royal court, she is isolated, but is befriended by Grigori <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasputin" title="Rasputin">Rasputin</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Baker" title="Tom Baker">Tom Baker</a>), a Siberian peasant who describes himself as a religious pilgrim or holy man. He has become a curiosity with some people at court. Later Alexandra calls upon him to help her pray for Alexei, and comes to believe in his healing, life-saving abilities.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a textile mill, working under ghastly conditions, the people are encouraged by their priest, Father <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gapon" title="George Gapon">George Gapon</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Glover" title="Julian Glover">Julian Glover</a>).

Hundreds of soldiers stand ready in front of the palace; their commanding officer tells them to shoot up in the air, but he falls from his horse, there is a panic, and the soldiers proceed to fire randomly into the crowd. Nicholas has not been at the palace and is horrified when he hears of the massacre, but admits he wouldn't have granted the people's requests.

Alexei (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roderic_Noble" title="Roderic Noble">Roderic Noble</a>) is a very lively little boy who is constantly prevented from leading a normal life. A close bond, however, exists between Alexei and his bodyguard/protector, the Russian Naval Sailor Nagorny (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hallam" title="John Hallam">John Hallam</a>). Prime Minister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyotr_Stolypin" title="Pyotr Stolypin">Pyotr Stolypin</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Porter" title="Eric Porter">Eric Porter</a>), who succeeded Witte, has commissioned the Imperial Duma and granted some of the people's requests in order to preserve the Russian Empire. Prime Minister Stolypin also presents Nicholas with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a> reports about Rasputin's dissolute behavior, which is serving to give the Tsar a bad reputation. As a result, the Tsar dismisses Rasputin from the court. Alexandra demands his return. She knows Alexei's hemophilia was inherited from her, and is wracked with guilt. She is obsessed with the thought that only Rasputin can stop the bleeding attacks when they occur.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Tercenteniary celebration occurs in a grand fashion with much partying and festivities, but takes a turn for the worse when Prime Minister Stolypin is shot at an opera performance in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> begins with the assassination of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduke_Franz_Ferdinand_of_Austria" title="Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria">Archduke Ferdinand</a>. Germany declares war on Russia immediately after Nicholas has ordered the mobilisation of Russia's forces on the German border. Nicholas decides to command the troops himself in 1915 and leaves for the front, taking over from his much more experienced cousin, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duke_Nicholas" title="Grand Duke Nicholas">Grand Duke Nicholas</a>. This leaves Alexandra in charge at home. Under Rasputin's influence and her own conservative inclinations, she makes unwise decisions. Very few people have been told about Alexei's illness or how Rasputin appears to be helping him, so it looks like the Tsaritsa is losing her mind, or perhaps having an affair with Rasputin. Out on the front lines, Nicholas is visited by his mother the Dowager Empress Maria Foeodorovna (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Worth" title="Irene Worth">Irene Worth</a>), (who is very outspokenly critical of her son's lack of leadership abilities), who scolds him about not attending to crumbling domestic issues and implores him to eliminate Rasputin (as well as to send Alexandra away to one of the royal palaces out of sight). On a sort of drunken whim, two decadent young princes, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duke_Dmitri" title="Grand Duke Dmitri">Grand Duke Dmitri</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Warwick" title="Richard Warwick">Richard Warwick</a>) and Prince <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Yusupov" title="Felix Yusupov">Felix Yusupov</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Potter_(actor)" title="Martin Potter (actor)">Martin Potter</a>), invite Rasputin to an opium party and kill him in December, 1916.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The family (and Dr. Botkin (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_West" title="Timothy West">Timothy West</a>) and Nagorny) are forced to leave the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo by Kerensky and are brought to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> in mid-1917, where they live under less grand conditions with rough but decent guards. In late 1917, Russia falls into the hands of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> party, the one revolutionary group that nobody took seriously. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a> starts very soon afterwards, and the family is transferred to the grim <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipatiev_House" title="Ipatiev House">Ipatiev House</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekaterinburg" title="Ekaterinburg">Ekaterinburg</a>, under harsher conditions, and into the keeping of the cold-blooded and unfeeling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yakov_Yurovsky" title="Yakov Yurovsky">Yakov Yurovsky</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Webb_(actor)" title="Alan Webb (actor)">Alan Webb</a>) (whom Alexei immediately pegs as an evil man). At one point, some of the guards are physically harsh with young Alexei, so Nagorny leaps to his defense and attacks them. Nagorny is taken away and shot, leaving Alexei even more embittered and withdrawn than he was before. In a near-final tragic scene, the family is shown laughing as they read previously withheld letters from friends, relatives and teachers. Only Alexei remains aloof, sensing what is about to happen. The Bolsheviks are frantically deciding what to do as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Army" title="White Army">White Army</a> is on the verge on capturing Ekaterinburg. In the middle of the night of July 17/18, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918" title="1918">1918</a>, the Bolsheviks awaken the Romanov family and Dr. Botkin. Told they're being sent to another city, the family and the doctor pack their things and wait in the cellar. Their keeper Yurovsky and his assistants enter the room, as Alexei kisses his father for the last time. They point their guns at the family, causing Olga (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ania_Marson" title="Ania Marson">Ania Marson</a>) and Tatiana (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynne_Frederick" title="Lynne Frederick">Lynne Frederick</a>) to scream, Maria (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Glendenning" title="Candace Glendenning">Candace Glendenning</a>) to run into the doctor's arms and Alexandra to cross herself. Then they open fire, and the first bullet goes through Nicholas' hand. The end scene shows the wall covered in blood.</p>

      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>Stolypin's assassination is portrayed accurately, but actually took place in 1911. Stolypin is shown as being present at the Tercentenary, which was not until 1913.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>The party at which Rasputin is poisoned is disputed, partly because of the uncertainty on the part of historians over what really happened that night. The scene is thus based on the legend of Rasputin's murder, as crafted by Yussupov over many tellings. Rasputin's death is portrayed in that he still lived after the poisoning and numerous gunshot wounds. The scene is also made to look as if Rasputin's murder was spur-of-the-moment from an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium" title="Opium">opium</a> high, when the three conspirators involved, Yussopov, Dmitiri, and their butler, recounted that there had been an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_degree_murder" title="First degree murder">intentional and thought-out</a> plan to murder Rasputin, albeit a poorly-designed one.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>In the film, the Tsarina Alexandra's German heritage is blamed for some of the family's unpopularity. Russian commoners found an excuse to hate the Empress in the last years of her husband's reign because Russia and Germany were at war, and as the daughter of German prince, Alexandra's connections to the enemy were, for many, too close for comfort. Ironically, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Romanov" title="House of Romanov">House of Romanov</a> had ceased to be predominantly Russian in 1730, following the death of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_II_of_Russia" title="Peter II of Russia">Peter II</a>. The Hollstein-Gottorp-Romanov lineage that succeeded it was part German, so the Tsarina's heritage by this time was - for those who knew the facts - not so different from her husband's.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>When the Romanovs are executed, not a word is spoken to them prior to their death. Most historical accounts indicate that an execution order was read to them beforehand.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	<li>The Romanov family (formed by the Tsar, his wife and their five children) were executed together with four faithful servants: doctor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene_Botkin" title="Eugene Botkin">Eugene Botkin</a>, chambermaid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Demidova" title="Anna Demidova">Anna Demidova</a>, cook <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Kharitonov" title="Ivan Kharitonov">Ivan Kharitonov</a>, and footman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Trupp" title="Alexei Trupp">Alexei Trupp</a>.

	<li>There are no facts to substantiate that the scene with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatiana_Nicolaievna_Romanova" title="Tatiana Nicolaievna Romanova">Tatiana</a> exposing herself to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik" title="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> soldier ever occurred.</li>

Britain was actually ready to accept the Romanovs, though with some reluctance. When it was made public that the Romanovs would be sent abroad, the public outcry against it was so overwhelming that the Provisional Government decided to keep them as prisoners, as its own future was on shaky ground. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI6" title="MI6">MI6</a> had proposed an idea of a covert extraction of the Tsar and his family, but all died before such a mission could be sanctioned.</li>
