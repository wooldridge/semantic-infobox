Zellweger acted in several school plays and was voted the "Best Looking" of her class before graduating from high school in 1987. After high school, she went to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_at_Austin" title="University of Texas at Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> to major in English language.

The performance earned her an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Spirit_Award" title="Independent Spirit Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> for Best Debut Performance. She subsequently moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, winning roles in the films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Records" title="Empire Records">Empire Records</a></i> (1995) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Whole_Wide_World" title="The Whole Wide World">The Whole Wide World</a></i> (1996). Zellweger first became widely known to audiences around the world with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Maguire" title="Jerry Maguire">Jerry Maguire</a></i> (1996), in which she played the romantic interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>'s character.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Zellweger later won acclaim in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_True_Thing" title="One True Thing">One True Thing</a></i> (1998) opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hurt" title="William Hurt">William Hurt</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meryl_Streep" title="Meryl Streep">Meryl Streep</a>, and in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_LaBute" title="Neil LaBute">Neil LaBute</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_Betty" title="Nurse Betty">Nurse Betty</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>. The role garnered the actress her first of three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Awards</a>, but she was in the bathroom when future co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant" title="Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a> announced her name. Zellweger later protested: "I had lipstick on my teeth!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001, Zellweger gained the prized lead role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones" title="Bridget Jones">Bridget Jones</a>, playing alongside Hugh Grant and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Firth" title="Colin Firth">Colin Firth</a>, in the British romantic comedy film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary_(film)" title="Bridget Jones's Diary (film)">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>,</i> based on the 1996 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones%27s_Diary" title="Bridget Jones's Diary">Bridget Jones's Diary</a></i> by Helen Fielding. The choice came amid much controversy since she was neither <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> nor overweight. During casting Zellweger was told she was too skinny to play the chubby Bridget, so she quickly embarked on gaining the required weight and learning an English accent. She gained 20 pounds in order to complete her transformation to Bridget Jones. Her dramatic weight fluctuations became the subject of much media interest. Her performance as Bridget received praise from critics, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Holden" title="Stephen Holden">Stephen Holden</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> commenting, "Ms. Zellweger accomplishes the small miracle of making Bridget both entirely endearing and utterly real." Along with receiving voice coaching to fine-tune her English accent, part of Zellweger's preparations involved spending three weeks working undercover in a "work experience placement" for British publishing firm <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picador_(imprint)" title="Picador (imprint)">Picador</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria,_London" title="Victoria, London">Victoria, London</a>. As a result of her considerable efforts to effect author <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Fielding" title="Helen Fielding">Helen Fielding</a>'s character, Zellweger caught the attention of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>, and won her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress Academy Award</a> nomination.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For two years, Zellweger dated <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Stripes" title="The White Stripes">The White Stripes</a> singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White_(musician)" title="Jack White (musician)">Jack White</a>. The pair met while filming <i>Cold Mountain</i>, and later began dating after the film wrapped. They broke up two years later, after schedule demands kept them apart. Friends said the split was amicable.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On May 9, 2005, Zellweger married singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Chesney" title="Kenny Chesney">Kenny Chesney</a> in a ceremony at the island of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_John,_United_States_Virgin_Islands" title="Saint John, United States Virgin Islands">St. John</a>.

Zellweger missed out on the engagement ring since the wedding was planned over a short span of time. On September 15, 2005, after only four months of marriage, they announced their plans for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annulment" title="Annulment">annulment</a>. Zellweger cited "fraud" as the reason in the related papers. After media scrutiny of her use of the word "fraud", she qualified the use of the term, stating it was "simply legal language and not a reflection of Kenny's character. I would personally be very grateful for your support in refraining from drawing derogatory, hurtful, sensationalized or untrue conclusions. We hope to experience this transition as privately as possible." The annulment was finalized in late December 2005.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2002, Zellweger bought a US$6.8-million home in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel-Air,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Bel-Air, Los Angeles, California">Bel Air</a>, then sold her previous home in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Hills" title="Hollywood Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>, bought for US$1.9M in 2000. Due to the constant attention from the paparazzi, she purchased a home in Connecticut and moved there in 2005. She claims she rarely spends time there, and keeps a small apartment in New York where she "stops over" to do laundry before moving on to her next film. In January 2007, she admitted that she gets scared at home alone due to security problems and fans who send or leave mail at her homes; she said that she considered buying a gun for reasons of personal security.</p>

A sequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_Jones:_The_Edge_of_Reason_(film)" title="Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason (film)">Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason</a></i>, was released in 2004.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Actresses who were considered for the role of Bridget Jones were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helena_Bonham_Carter" title="Helena Bonham Carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Watson" title="Emily Watson">Emily Watson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Weisz" title="Rachel Weisz">Rachel Weisz</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Diaz" title="Cameron Diaz">Cameron Diaz</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Collette" title="Toni Collette">Toni Collette</a> declined the role because she was on Broadway starring in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Party_(LaChiusa_musical)" title="The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)">The Wild Party</a></i> at the time, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet" title="Kate Winslet">Kate Winslet</a> was considered but the producers decided she was too young.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the film was released, a considerable amount of controversy surrounded the casting of the American Zellweger as what some saw as a quintessentially British heroine. However, her performance is widely considered to be of a high standard, including her English accent. Fielding has stated in many interviews that her novel was based upon both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen" title="Jane Austen">Jane Austen</a>'s work <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice" title="Pride and Prejudice">Pride and Prejudice</a></i> and its popular <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice_(1995_TV_serial)" title="Pride and Prejudice (1995 TV serial)">1995 BBC adaptation</a>. This was also reflected in the decision to cast Colin Firth as Darcy, since he played the 'real' <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Darcy" title="Mr. Darcy">Mr. Darcy</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> adaptation of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. This is not the film's only connection to that serial â€“ the screenplay was co-written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Davies_(writer)" title="Andrew Davies (writer)">Andrew Davies</a>, who had written the adaptation of Austen's novel for the BBC. Another co-writer was Richard Curtis, and there are elements of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Weddings_and_a_Funeral" title="Four Weddings and a Funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></i> and even more so of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notting_Hill" title="Notting Hill">Notting Hill</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The director of the film, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Maguire" title="Sharon Maguire">Sharon Maguire</a>, is one of Fielding's friends whom the character of "Shazzer" was reportedly based on. In the film, "Shazzer" was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Phillips" title="Sally Phillips">Sally Phillips</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RenÃ©e Zellweger was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for her role in the film.</p>

She works in publicity at a book publishing company in London where her main focus is fantasising about her boss, Daniel Cleaver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Grant" title="Hugh Grant">Hugh Grant</a>). At a Christmas party hosted by her parents, she meets Mark Darcy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Firth" title="Colin Firth">Colin Firth</a>), the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrister" title="Barrister">barrister</a> son of her parents' friends. After their initial meeting, Mark thinks that Bridget is a fool, and Bridget thinks that he is arrogant and rude. On New Year's Day, she finally decides to turn it all around and starts her own diary, which covers all her attempts to stop smoking, lose weight, and catch her Mr. Right.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bridget and Daniel begin to flirt heavily at work, first over email. They eventually start dating, despite the fact that he is a notorious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Womaniser" title="Womaniser">womaniser</a> with a questionable personality, of which Bridget is aware, from when stating earlier in the film that she will not form relationships with people who are a "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">alcoholic</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workaholic" title="Workaholic">workaholic</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeping_Tom" title="Peeping Tom">peeping-tom</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalomania" title="Megalomania">megalomaniac</a>, emotional fuckwit or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverts" title="Perverts">perverts</a>". Bridget learns from Daniel that he and Mark have a history and as a result, hate each other. Daniel informs Bridget of their fallout, telling her that Mark broke their friendship by sleeping with his fiancÃ©e.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daniel's dubious character becomes clearer and clearer to Bridget, and eventually she breaks off their relationship when she catches him with another woman, a colleague of his, Lara (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Barbuscia" title="Lisa Barbuscia">Lisa Barbuscia</a>), from work in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>.

He later helps Bridgette to land a major interview for work. Bridget begins to develop feelings for Mark. Just as Bridget and Mark's mutual attraction for each other comes together at a birthday dinner party hosted by Bridget, Daniel comes back into the picture temporarily claiming Bridget's attention. Mark originally leaves the party, but comes back to face Daniel. Mark punches Daniel and the two fight, the fight moves into a near by restaurant where Mark and Daniel smash through the window landing on the street. Mark wins the battle and knocks Daniel out. Bridget, still thinking that Daniel had been the wronged one, chastises Mark. Afterward, she tells Daniel that she doesn't want to be with him.</p>
