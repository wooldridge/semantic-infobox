	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Sir Laurence Olivier</a>, who invited him to join the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_National_Theatre" title="Royal National Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a>.

Olivier later noted in his memoir, <i>Confessions of an Actor</i>, that, "A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Flea_in_Her_Ear" title="A Flea in Her Ear">A Flea in Her Ear</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravda_(play)" title="Pravda (play)">Pravda</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hare_(playwright)" title="David Hare (playwright)">David Hare</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Brenton" title="Howard Brenton">Howard Brenton</a> and as Antony in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_Cleopatra" title="Antony and Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Dench" title="Judi Dench">Judi Dench</a> as well as in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Shaffer" title="Peter Shaffer">Peter Shaffer</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equus_(play)" title="Equus (play)">Equus</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dexter" title="John Dexter">John Dexter</a>) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He has since gone on to enjoy a long career, winning many plaudits and awards for his performances. Hopkins was made a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_British_Empire" title="Order of the British Empire">Commander of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1987, and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_Bachelor" title="Knight Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in 1993. In 1996, Hopkins was awarded an honorary fellowship from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wales,_Lampeter" title="University of Wales, Lampeter">University of Wales, Lampeter</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hopkins has stated that his role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Munro" title="Burt Munro">Burt Munro</a>, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Fastest_Indian" title="The World's Fastest Indian">The World's Fastest Indian</a></i>, was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Cecil_B._DeMille_Award" title="Golden Globe Cecil B.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hopkins is set to portray <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Odin (Marvel Comics)">Odin</a>, the father of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Thor (Marvel Comics)">Thor</a>, in the upcoming film adaptation of Marvel Comics' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(film)" title="Thor (film)">Thor</a></i>. On 24 February 2010 it was announced that Hopkins had been cast in the upcoming supernatural thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rite_(2011_film)" title="The Rite (2011 film)">The Rite</a></i>. He will play a priest who is "an expert in exorcisms and whose methods are not necessarily traditional".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He has confessed in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can "do it without thinking". This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Attenborough" title="Richard Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>, who has directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowlands_(film)" title="Shadowlands (film)">Shadowlands</a></i> (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Winger" title="Debra Winger">Debra Winger</a>), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for "this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, Hopkins is a gifted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic" title="Mimic">mimic</a>, adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spartacus_(film)" title="Spartacus (film)">Spartacus</a></i> in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson_(TV_series)" title="Parkinson (TV series)">Parkinson</a></i> featured an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impersonation" title="Impersonation">impersonation</a> of comedian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Cooper" title="Tommy Cooper">Tommy Cooper</a>. Hopkins has said acting "like a submarine" has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies. He said, "It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Perhaps Hopkins' most famous role is as the cannibalistic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter" title="Hannibal Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silence_of_the_Lambs_(film)" title="The Silence of the Lambs (film)">The Silence of the Lambs</a></i>, for which he won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> in 1991, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Foster" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarice_Starling" title="Clarice Starling">Clarice Starling</a>, who won for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress</a>. The film won <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Writing_Adapted_Screenplay" title="Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>. It is one of the shortest lead performances to win an Oscar, as Hopkins only appears on screen for little over 24 minutes. Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_(film)" title="Hannibal (film)">Hannibal</a></i> in 2001, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dragon_(film)" title="Red Dragon (film)">Red Dragon</a></i> in 2002). His original portrayal of the character in <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> has been labelled by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> as the number-one film villain. At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Butterfly" title="M. Butterfly">M. Butterfly</a></i>. He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, "Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harris" title="Thomas Harris">Thomas Harris</a>. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that <i>Red Dragon</i> would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Rising_(film)" title="Hannibal Rising (film)">Hannibal Rising</a></i>.</p>

However, he decided to return to the U.S. following his 1990s success. He became a naturalized citizen on 12 April 2000, and celebrated with a 3,000-mile road trip across the country.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eric Hamburg, former speechwriter and staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, got the idea of a film about Nixon after having dinner with Oliver Stone. Originally, Oliver Stone had been developing two projects â€” the musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evita_(film)" title="Evita (film)">Evita</a></i> and a movie about Panamanian dictator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Noriega" title="Manuel Noriega">Manuel Noriega</a>. When they both did not get made, Stone turned his attention to a biopic about Richard Nixon. The former President's death on April 22, 1994, was also a key factor in Stone's decision to make a Nixon film. He pitched the film to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, but, according to the director, they saw it, "as a bunch of unattractive older white men sitting around in suits, with a lot of dialogue and not enough action".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1993, Hamburg mentioned the idea of a Nixon film to writer Stephen J. Rivele with the concept being that they would incorporate all of the politician's misdeeds, both known and speculative. Rivele liked the idea and had previously thought about writing a play exploring the same themes. Hamburg encouraged Rivele to write a film instead and with his screenwriting partner, Christopher Wilkinson, they wrote a treatment on November 1993. They conceived of a concept referred to as "the Beast", which Wilkinson describes as "a headless monster that lurches through postwar history," a metaphor for a system of dark forces that resulted in the assassinations of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F.

Kennedy</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kennedy" title="Robert Kennedy">Robert Kennedy</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">Martin Luther King, Jr.</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a>, and helped Nixon's rise to power and his fall from it as well. Stone said in an interview that Nixon realizes that "the Beast" "is more powerful than he is. We can't get into it that much, but we hint at it so many times â€” the military-industrial complex, the forces of money". In another interview, the director elaborates, "I see the Beast in its essence as a System ... which grinds the individual down ... it's a System of checks and balances that drives itself off: 1) the power of money and markets; 2) State power, Government power; 3) corporate power, which is probably greater than state power; 4) the political process, or election through money, which is therefore in tow to the System; and 5) the media, which mostly protects the status quo and their ownership's interests". It was this concept that convinced Stone to make <i>Nixon</i> and he told Hamburg to hire Rivele and Wilkinson. Stone commissioned the first draft of the film's screenplay in the fall of 1993. Rivele and Wilkinson delivered the first draft of their script on June 17, 1994, the anniversary of the Watergate break-in. Stone loved the script but felt that the third act and the ending needed more work. They wrote another draft and delivered it on August 9, the 20th anniversary of Nixon's resignation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone immersed himself in research with the help of Hamburg. With Hamburg and actors Hopkins and James Woods, Stone flew to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> and interviewed the surviving members of Nixon's inner circle: lawyer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Garment" title="Leonard Garment">Leonard Garment</a> and Attorney General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliot_Richardson" title="Elliot Richardson">Elliot Richardson</a>. He also interviewed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara" title="Robert McNamara">Robert McNamara</a>, a former Secretary of Defense under the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. The director also hired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Butterfield" title="Alexander Butterfield">Alexander Butterfield</a>, a key figure in the Watergate scandal who handled the flow of paper to the President, as a consultant to make sure that the Oval Office was realistically depicted, former deputy White House counsel <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sears_(political_strategist)" title="John Sears (political strategist)">John Sears</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dean" title="John Dean">John Dean</a>, who made sure that every aspect of the script was accurate and wrote a few uncredited scenes for the film. Butterfield also appears in a few scenes as a White House staffer. To research their roles, Powers Boothe, David Hyde Pierce and Paul Sorvino talked to their real-life counterparts, but J.T. Walsh decided not to contact <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman" title="John Ehrlichman">John Ehrlichman</a> because he had threatened to sue after reading an early version of the script and was not happy with how he was portrayed. Hopkins watched a lot of documentary footage on Nixon. At night, he would go to sleep with the Nixon footage playing, letting it seep into his subconscious. Hopkins said, "It's taking in all this information and if you're relaxed enough, it begins to take you over."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stone originally had a three-picture deal with New Regency Films which included <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JFK_(film)" title="JFK (film)">JFK</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven_%26_Earth_(1993_film)" title="Heaven &amp; Earth (1993 film)">Heaven and Earth</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Born_Killers" title="Natural Born Killers">Natural Born Killers</a></i>. After the success of <i>Killers</i>, Arnon Milchan, head of New Regency, signed Stone for three more motion pictures. Stone could make any film up to a budget of $42.5 million. When Stone told Milchan that he wanted to make <i>Nixon</i>, Milchan, who was not keen on the idea, told the director that he would only give him $35 million, thinking that this would cause Stone to abandon the project. Stone took the project to Hungarian financier <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Vajna" title="Andrew Vajna">Andrew Vajna</a> who had co-financing deal with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a>. Vajna's company, Cinergi Films, were willing to finance the $38 million film. This angered Milchan who claimed that <i>Nixon</i> was his film because of his three-picture deal with Stone and he threatened to sue. He withdrew after Stone paid him an undisclosed amount. Stone was finalizing the film's budget a week before shooting was to begin. He made a deal with Cinergi and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Pictures" title="Hollywood Pictures">Hollywood Pictures</a> in order to supply the $43 million budget. To cut costs, Stone leased the White House sets from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Reiner" title="Rob Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>'s film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_President" title="The American President">The American President</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film began shooting on May 1, 1995 but there was a week of pre-shooting at the end of April to film scenes that would be used as part of a mock documentary about Nixon's career. Early on during principal photography, Hopkins was intimidated by the amount of dialogue he had to learn, that was being added and changed all the time as he recalled, "There were moments when I wanted to get out, when I wanted to just do a nice <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knots_Landing" title="Knots Landing">Knots Landing</a></i> or something". Sorvino told him that his accent was all wrong. Sorvino claims that he told Hopkins that he thought "there was room for improvement" and that he would be willing to help him. Woods says that Sorvino told Hopkins that he was "doing the whole thing wrong" and that he was an "expert" who could help him. Woods recalls that Sorvino took Hopkins to lunch and then he quit that afternoon. Hopkins told Stone that he wanted to quit the production but the director managed to convince him to stay. According to the actors, this was all good-natured joking. Woods said, "I'd always tell him how great he was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1960_film)" title="Psycho (1960 film)">Psycho</a></i>. I'd call him Lady Perkins all the time instead of Sir Anthony Hopkins".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Spring of 1994, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine reported that an early draft of the screenplay linked Nixon to the assassination of President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. The facts contained in the script were based on research from various sources, including documents, transcripts and hours of footage from the Nixon White House. Dean said about the film's accuracy: "In the larger picture, it reflected accurately what happened". Stone addressed the criticism of fictional material in the film, saying, "The material we invented was not done haphazardly or whimsically, it was based on research and interpretation". John Taylor, head of the Nixon Presidential Library, leaked a copy of the script to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Helms" title="Richard Helms">Richard Helms</a>, former Director of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a>, who threatened to sue the production. In response, Stone cut out all scenes with Helms from the theatrical print and claimed that he did for "artistic reasons" only to reinstate this footage on the home video release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the post-production phase, Stone had his editors in three different rooms with the scenes from the film revolving from one room to another, "depending on how successful they were". If one editor wasn't successful with a scene then it went to another. Stone said that it was "the most intense post- I've ever done, even more intense than <i>JFK</i>" because they were screening the film three times a week, making changes in 48â€“72 hours, rescreening the film and then making another 48 hours of changes.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In its opening weekend, <i>Nixon</i> grossed a total of $2.2 million in 514 theaters. As of December 19, 2006, the film has grossed a total of $13.6 million in the United States and Canada, well below its $44 million budget. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and holds a 75% rating at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two days before the film was released in theaters, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon_Library" title="Richard Nixon Library">Richard Nixon Library</a> and birthplace in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorba_Linda,_California" title="Yorba Linda, California">Yorba Linda, California</a> issued a statement on behalf of the Nixon family, calling parts of the film "reprehensible" and that it was designed to "defame and degrade President and Mrs. Nixon's memories in the mind of the American public". This statement was based on a published copy of the script. The statement also criticized Stone's depiction of Nixon's private life, that of his childhood, and his part in planning the assassination of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a>. Stone responded that his "purpose in making the film, <i>Nixon</i> was neither malicious nor defamatory", and was an attempt to gain "a fuller understanding of the life and career of Richard Nixon â€” the good and the bad, the triumphs and the tragedies, and the legacy he left his nation and the world". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>'s daughter, Diane Disney Miller, wrote a letter to Nixon's daughters saying that Stone had "committed a grave disservice to your family, to the Presidency, and to American history". Stone does not see his film as the definitive statement on Nixon but as "a basis to start reading, to start investigating on your own".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some critics took Stone to task for portraying Nixon as an alcoholic, though Stone says that was based on information from books by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Ambrose" title="Stephen Ambrose">Stephen Ambrose</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fawn_Brodie" title="Fawn Brodie">Fawn Brodie</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wicker" title="Tom Wicker">Tom Wicker</a>. Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> praised the film for how it took "on the resonance of classic tragedy. Tragedy requires the fall of a hero, and one of the achievements of <i>Nixon</i> is to show that greatness was within his reach". Ebert also placed the film on his list of the top ten films of the year. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin" title="Janet Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> praised Anthony Hopkins' performance and "his character's embattled outlook and stiff, hunched body language with amazing skill". However, Mick LaSalle in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i>, felt that "the problem here isn't accuracy. It's absurdity. Hopkins' exaggerated portrayal of Nixon is the linchpin of a film that in its conception and presentation consistently veers into camp". Richard Corliss, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>, also had a problem with Hopkins' portrayal: "Hopkins, though, is a failure. He finds neither the timber of Nixon's plummy baritone, with its wonderfully false attempts at intimacy, nor the stature of a career climber who, with raw hands, scaled the mountain and was still not high or big enough".</p>
