	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a young man, Scott's original ambition was to be a writer like his favorite author, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, and while in high school, he wrote many short stories, none of which were ever published. As an adult, he tried on many occasions to write a novel, but was never able to complete one to his satisfaction. When asked by an interviewer in later life which contemporary novelists he admired, he replied, "I stopped reading novels when I stopped trying to write them."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott joined the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">US Marines</a>, serving from 1945 until 1949, and was assigned to the prestigious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Barracks,_Washington,_D.C." title="Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.">8th and I Barracks</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> In that capacity, he served as a guard at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_National_Cemetery" title="Arlington National Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a> and taught English literature and radio speaking/writing at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Institute" title="Marine Corps Institute">Marine Corps Institute</a>. He later said that his duties at Arlington led to his drinking.</p>

In voice, appearance, and personality, many say he resembled the Minnesota politician and baseball magnate Bob Short.</p>

In 1958, he won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obie_Award" title="Obie Award">Obie Award</a> for his performances in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_Darkness" title="Children of Darkness">Children of Darkness</a></i> (in which he made the first of many appearances opposite his future wife, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Dewhurst" title="Colleen Dewhurst">Colleen Dewhurst</a>), for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_You_Like_It" title="As You Like It">As You Like It</a></i>, and for playing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_of_England" title="Richard III of England">Richard III of England</a> to particular acclaim in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_III_(play)" title="Richard III (play)">Richard III</a></i> (a performance one critic said was the "angriest" Richard III of all time). He was on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> the following year, winning critical acclaim for his portrayal of the prosecutor in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Andersonville_Trial" title="The Andersonville Trial">The Andersonville Trial</a></i> by Saul Levitt. This was based on the military trial of the commandant of the infamous Civil War prison camp in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andersonville,_Georgia" title="Andersonville, Georgia">Andersonville, Georgia</a>. His performance earned him a mention in <i>Time</i> magazine as a rising young actor of great intensity. In 1970 Scott directed a highly acclaimed television version of this same play. It starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shatner" title="William Shatner">William Shatner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Basehart" title="Richard Basehart">Richard Basehart</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Cassidy" title="Jack Cassidy">Jack Cassidy</a>, who was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> for his performance as the defense lawyer in this production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott continued to appear in and sometimes direct Broadway productions throughout the 1960s.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott appeared in many television series too, including the 1962 role of Arthur Lilly in the episode "The Brazen Bell" in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a> series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virginian_(TV_series)" title="The Virginian (TV series)">The Virginian</a></i>, in which he recites Oscar Wilde's poem "The Ballad Of Reading Gaol".

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1963, Scott was top billed in the critically acclaimed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Broadcasting_System" title="Columbia Broadcasting System">CBS</a> hour-long drama series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Side,_West_Side" title="East Side, West Side">East Side, West Side</a></i>; he and co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicely_Tyson" title="Cicely Tyson">Cicely Tyson</a> played urban social workers.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott's most famous early role was in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove,_or_How_I_Learned_to_Stop_Worrying_and_Love_the_Bomb" title="Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb">Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</a>,</i> where he played the part of General "Buck" Turgidson. It is revealed on the DVD documentary that after having shot many takes of any given scene, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> would frequently ask Scott to redo it in an "over the top" fashion. Kubrick would then proceed to use this version in the final cut, which Scott supposedly resented. However, Kubrick did earn Scott's respect on this film, since by that time Scott was an accomplished chess player. The cast and crew noted that they would often play chess between takes, and Kubrick was the only person who could routinely beat him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott's portrayal of the swaggering and controversial <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Patton" title="George S. Patton">George S. Patton</a> in the 1970 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i> has become, to many, his greatest performance. Many film critics and historians consider it one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema. Scott had researched extensively for the role, studying films of the general and talking to those who knew him. Having declined an Academy Award nomination for his appearance in the 1961 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hustler_(film)" title="The Hustler (film)">The Hustler</a>,</i> Scott returned his Oscar for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_(film)" title="Patton (film)">Patton</a></i>, stating in a letter to the Academy that he didn't feel himself to be in competition with other actors. However, also regarding this second rejection of the Academy Award, Scott famously said elsewhere, "The whole thing is a goddamn meat parade. I don't want any part of it." Sixteen years later, in 1986, Scott reprised his Patton title role in a made-for-television sequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Days_of_Patton" title="The Last Days of Patton">The Last Days of Patton</a></i>. The movie was based on Patton's final weeks after being mortally injured in a car accident, with flashbacks of Patton's life. At the time that sequel was aired, Scott mentioned in a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> interview that he had verbally told the Academy to donate his Oscar to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_Museum" title="Patton Museum">Patton Museum</a>; since the instructions were never put in writing, it was never delivered. The Oscar is currently displayed at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Military_Institute" title="Virginia Military Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a> museum in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Virginia" title="Lexington, Virginia">Lexington, Virginia</a>, the same institution that generations of Pattons have attended. Scott did not turn down the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Award" title="New York Film Critics Award">New York Film Critics Award</a> for his performance (of which his wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colleen_Dewhurst" title="Colleen Dewhurst">Colleen Dewhurst</a> said, "George thinks this is the only film award worth having").</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He continued to do stage work throughout the rest of his career, receiving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Award" title="Tony Award">Tony Award</a> nominations for his Astrov in a revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Vanya" title="Uncle Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a></i> (1973), his Willy Loman in a revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman" title="Death of a Salesman">Death of a Salesman</a></i> (1975), and his Henry Drummond in a revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherit_the_Wind_(play)" title="Inherit the Wind (play)">Inherit the Wind</a></i> (1996), the latter despite his having to miss an unusually large number of performances due to illness, with his role being taken over by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Actors_Theatre" title="National Actors Theatre">National Actors Theatre</a> artistic director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Randall" title="Tony Randall">Tony Randall</a>. In 1996, he also won an honorary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drama_Desk_Award" title="Drama Desk Award">Drama Desk Award</a> for a lifetime devotion to theatre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Scott also starred in well-received productions of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Gelbart" title="Larry Gelbart">Larry Gelbart</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sly_Fox" title="Sly Fox">Sly Fox</a></i> (1976) (based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Jonson" title="Ben Jonson">Ben Jonson</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volpone" title="Volpone">Volpone</a>)</i>, which ran 495 performances, and a revival of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noel_Coward" title="Noel Coward">Noel Coward</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Present_Laughter" title="Present Laughter">Present Laughter</a></i> (1982).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1971, Scott gave two more critically acclaimed performances, as a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto" title="De facto">de facto</a></i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/They_Might_Be_Giants_(film)" title="They Might Be Giants (film)">They Might Be Giants</a></i> and as an alcoholic doctor in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy" title="Black comedy">black comedy</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hospital" title="The Hospital">The Hospital</a>.</i> Despite his repeated snubbing of the Academy, Scott was again nominated for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a> for the latter role. Scott excelled on television that year as well, appearing in an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>'s <i>The Price</i>, an installment of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallmark_Hall_of_Fame" title="Hallmark Hall of Fame">Hallmark Hall of Fame</a></i> anthology. He was nominated for, and won, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> for his role, which he accepted. His reasoning for keeping an Emmy after rejecting an Oscar was believed to be because the Emmy Award winners were chosen by blue-ribbon panels of experts, while Academy Award winners were chosen by the entire Academy membership.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The actor also starred in the popular 1980 horror film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Changeling_(film)" title="The Changeling (film)">The Changeling</a></i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Douglas" title="Melvyn Douglas">Melvyn Douglas</a>. He received the Canadian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_Award" title="Genie Award">Genie Award</a> for Best Foreign Film Actor for his performance.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Peninsula_of_Michigan" title="Upper Peninsula of Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a>, small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a>), a former <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano and hanging out with his alcoholic friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_O%27Connell" title="Arthur O'Connell">Arthur O'Connell</a>) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_Arden" title="Eve Arden">Eve Arden</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One day Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Remick" title="Lee Remick">Lee Remick</a>), wife of the loutish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army" title="US Army">US Army</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant" title="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> Frederick "Manny" Manion (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Gazzara" title="Ben Gazzara">Ben Gazzara</a>). It turns out that the Lieutenant has been arrested for first degree <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder" title="Murder">murder</a>, that of innkeeper Barney Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, which was committed after his wife claimed to have been raped by Quill.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Even with such a motivation, it would be difficult to get Manion cleared of murder, so Biegler pushes him into a position where he claims to have no memory of the event, thus giving them a chance of winning his freedom with a defense of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irresistible_impulse" title="Irresistible impulse">irresistible impulse</a> â€” a version of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_insanity" title="Temporary insanity">temporary insanity</a> defense.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As he sets about preparing his case, Biegler catches Laura Manion flirting with other army officers during a roadhouse party. He has to practically order her to stay away from "men, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juke_joint" title="Juke joint">juke joints</a>, booze, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinball_machine" title="Pinball machine">pinball machines</a>" and wear a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girdle" title="Girdle">girdle</a> in order to play the part of a "meek little housewife" rather than that of a happy-go-lucky party girl. She also agrees to give up her tight-fitting clothes and wears a formal dress, glasses, a hat and a woman's suit in court.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hides a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local D.A. (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Brooks_West&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Brooks West (page does not exist)">Brooks West</a>) is assisted by a high-powered big city prosecutor named Dancer (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_C._Scott" title="George C. Scott">George C. Scott</a>). Furthermore, the prosecution goes all the way to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill, i.e. the raping of Laura. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape issue into the record and Judge Weaver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Welch" title="Joseph N. Welch">Joseph N. Welch</a>) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. However, Dancer's cross-examination of Laura effectively portrays her as a woman who was not satisfied with her marriage and openly flirted with other men, including the one she claimed raped her.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A doctor casts doubt on whether she was raped or not, though Biegler questions the method he used to obtain the results, and psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind when he killed Quill. Furthermore it comes out that even Lt. Manion doubted his wife, as Laura, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic</a>, had to swear on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosary" title="Rosary">rosary</a> to persuade her husband that the sex with Quill was indeed non-consensual.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quill's inn is due to be inherited by Mary Pilant (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Crosby" title="Kathryn Crosby">Kathryn Grant</a>), a mysterious Canadian who is suspected of being his mistress. Biegler later learns that she is in fact Quill's daughter, but she is anxious to keep this secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade her that Al Paquette (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Hamilton" title="Murray Hamilton">Murray Hamilton</a>), a bartender who witnessed the murder, knows that Quill raped Laura but is covering this up, either out of love for Mary or loyalty to his late friend. Through Mary, Biegler tries to persuade Paquette to testify for the defense on these grounds but he refuses. Annoyed, Biegler leaves saying: "I'll leave a pass for you and Al at the trial. You might like to watch Lt. Manion get convicted."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mary does actually attend the final day of the trial when the issue is raised about the panties that Laura was wearing on the night of the murder. These panties were never found at the spot she claims the rape took place. Mary, who was unaware of this, later returns to testify that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room, presuming that Quill dropped them down the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laundry_chute" title="Laundry chute">laundry chute</a> when he returned home. Dancer insistently quizzes her that she was lying and that Quill was her lover. She shocks the court and torpedoes Dancer by stating the Quill was her father.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Biegler has played heavily on the issue that he is "just a humble country lawyer" facing a "brilliant prosecutor from the big city of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lansing,_Michigan" title="Lansing, Michigan">Lansing</a>", a factor which has played well with the jury. After the closing speeches however, he privately admits that Dancer delivered the "best summary I've ever heard in a courtroom". It is to no avail though: Manion is found "not guilty for reason of insanity".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next day Biegler and McCarthy go to see the Manions at their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_park" title="Trailer park">trailer park</a> home in order to collect their fee only to find the trailer missing. A note left by Manion tells Biegler that he was "seized by an irresistible impulse" â€” the defense used by Biegler during the trial. Evidence left lying around indicates that Manion was actually a heavy drinker who beat Laura before they left. This might indicate that Laura's sexual encounter with Quill was consensual and that Manion killed Quill out of drunken jealousy.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One controversial legal issue in this film is possible witness coaching, a violation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_ethics" title="Legal ethics">legal canons</a>. The only plausible legal defense Lt. Manion has â€“ the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity_defense" title="Insanity defense">insanity defense</a> â€“ is virtually spelled out to a befuddled Manion by his prospective counsel, who then temporarily suspends the conversation and suggests that Manion rethink his factual/legal position. Witness coaching by the prosecution is even more blatant as they call in other jail inmates awaiting sentencing to testify against Manion, and is portrayed as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subornation_of_perjury" title="Subornation of perjury">subornation of perjury</a> to an extent. The first suggests that the defendant may be concealing the truth and manipulating his story in order to obtain the best possible verdict, and the latter that the prosecution dangled a possible lighter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(law)" title="Sentence (law)">sentence</a> through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain" title="Plea bargain">plea bargain</a> as an incentive to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perjury" title="Perjury">perjury</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Thus, there could be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy" title="Synergy">synergy</a>: compounding the inherent fallible nature of the process with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malleability" title="Malleability">malleability</a> of memory, the potential <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendacity" title="Mendacity">mendacity</a> of witnesses, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showmanship_(performing)" title="Showmanship (performing)">showmanship</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legerdemain" title="Legerdemain">'magic tricks'</a> involved in trials and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advocacy" title="Advocacy">advocacy</a>, and the self interest, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venality" title="Venality">venality</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality" title="Morality">morality</a>, poor perception and recollection, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethical standards</a> of the participants. Indeed, the unreliability of judicial decisions based on demeanor is well established.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In protracted litigation, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation" title="Confabulation">confabulated memory</a> â€“ filling in the blanks and recreating memories â€“ is common, and research has documented the tendency. Repetitive and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suggestibility" title="Suggestibility">suggestive questioning</a> tends to plant the seeds of memory. The book and the movie are among the most cogent examples of the lawyers' dance. â€œHorse shedding" of witnesses is well known, if controversial and potentially unethical; it is not just an occasion to directly orchestrate perjury. What is more problematic is that it is possible to reach a point where â€œif you believe it, then it isnâ€™t a lie.â€&#157; Thus, even letter-perfect <i>bona fide</i> certainty of belief is not equivalent to a certification of accuracy or even truthfulness. This process is called "horse shedding," "sandpapering" or "wood shedding" â€“ the first and last names being metaphorical references to the location of such a "collaboration."</p>

Such a one is <i>Anatomy of a Murder,</i> which opened at the Criterion and the Plaza yesterday. It is the best courtroom melodrama this old judge has ever seen.Â .Â .Â . Outside of the fact that this drama gets a little tiring in spotsâ€”in its two hours and forty minutes, most of which is spent in courtâ€”it is well nigh flawless as a picture of an American court at work, of small-town American characters and of the average sordidness of crime." </p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite being heard "in bits and pieces" the score "contains some of his most evocative and eloquent musicâ€¦ and beckons with the alluring scent of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale" title="Femme fatale">femme fatale</a>." Including small pieces by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Strayhorn" title="Billy Strayhorn">Billy Strayhorn</a>, film historians recognize it "as a landmark â€” the first significant Hollywood film music by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Americans" title="African Americans">African Americans</a> comprising non-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegetic" title="Diegetic">diegetic</a> music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band." The score avoids cultural <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotypes" title="Stereotypes">stereotypes</a> which previously characterized jazz scores and "rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave" title="French New Wave">New Wave</a> cinema of the â€™60s."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The soundtrack, containing 13 tracks, was released on May 29, 1959.

The score employs a "handful of themes, endlessly recombined and re-orchestrated.

The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allmusic" title="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> review by Bruce Eder awarded the album 3 stars calling it "a virtuoso jazz score â€” moody, witty, sexy, and â€” in its own quiet way â€” playful".</p>
