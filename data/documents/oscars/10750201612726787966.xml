      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mann was born in Chicago of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jewish</a> heritage, the son of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grocer" title="Grocer">grocers</a> Esther and Jack Mann. His father was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukrainians" title="Ukrainians">Ukrainian</a> immigrant and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> combat veteran and his mother came from a family native to Chicago. Mann was close to his father and his paternal grandfather. He grew up in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_Park,_Chicago" title="Humboldt Park, Chicago">Humboldt Park</a> neighborhood and immersed himself in the burgeoning Chicago blues-music scene as a teenager.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He studied English at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison" title="University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison">University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison</a> and developed interests in history, philosophy and architecture. It was at this time that he first saw <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Strangelove" title="Dr. Strangelove">Dr. Strangelove</a></i> and fell in love with movies. In a recent <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Weekly" title="L.A. Weekly">L.A. Weekly</a></i> interview, he describes the film's impact on him: "It said to my whole generation of filmmakers that you could make an individual statement of high integrity and have that film be successfully seen by a mass audience all at the same time. In other words, you didnâ€™t have to be making <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Brides_for_Seven_Brothers_(film)" title="Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (film)">Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</a></i> if you wanted to work in the main stream film industry, or be reduced to niche filmmaking if you wanted to be serious about cinema. So thatâ€™s what Kubrick meant, aside from the fact that <i>Strangelove</i> was a revelation."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mann later moved to London in the mid 1960s to go to graduate school in cinema. He went on to receive a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_degree" title="Graduate degree">graduate degree</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Film_School" title="London Film School">London Film School</a>. He spent seven years in the United Kingdom going to film school and then working on commercials along with contemporaries <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Parker" title="Alan Parker">Alan Parker</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott">Ridley Scott</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Lyne" title="Adrian Lyne">Adrian Lyne</a>. In 1968, footage he shot of the Paris student revolt for a documentary, <i>Insurrection</i>, aired on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i>First Tuesday</i> news program and he developed his '68 experiences into the short film <i>Jaunpuri</i> which won the Jury Prize at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes</a> in 1970.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mann returned to United States after divorcing his first wife in 1971. He went on to direct a road trip documentary, <i>17 Days Down the Line</i>. Three years later, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Five-O" title="Hawaii Five-O">Hawaii Five-O</a></i> veteran <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Lewin" title="Robert Lewin">Robert Lewin</a> gave Mann a shot and a crash course on television writing and story structure. Mann wrote the first four episodes of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starsky_and_Hutch" title="Starsky and Hutch">Starsky and Hutch</a></i> and the pilot episode for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vega$" title="Vega$">Vega$</a></i>. Around this time, he worked on a show called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Story_(TV_series)" title="Police Story (TV series)">Police Story</a></i> with cop-turned-novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Wambaugh" title="Joseph Wambaugh">Joseph Wambaugh</a>. <i>Police Story</i> concentrated on the detailed realism of a real cop's life and taught Mann that first-hand research was essential to bring authenticity to his work.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first feature movie was a television special called <i>The Jericho Mile</i>, which was released theatrically in Europe. It won the Emmy for best MOW in 1979 and the DGA Best Director award. His television work also includes being the executive producer on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice" title="Miami Vice">Miami Vice</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_Story_(TV_series)" title="Crime Story (TV series)">Crime Story</a></i>. Contrary to popular belief, he is not the creator of these shows but the executive producer and the showrunner. They were produced by his production company. However, his cinematic influence is felt throughout each show in terms of casting and style.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mann is now known primarily as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_film" title="Feature film">feature film</a> director and he is considered to be one of America's top <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaker" title="Filmmaker">filmmakers</a>. He has a very distinctive style that is reflected in his works: his trademarks include unusual scores, such as Tangerine Dream in <i>Thief</i> or the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age_music" title="New Age music">New Age</a> score to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunter_(film)" title="Manhunter (film)">Manhunter</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Spinotti" title="Dante Spinotti">Dante Spinotti</a> is a frequent cinematographer of Mann's pictures.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mann's first cinema feature as director was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_(film)" title="Thief (film)">Thief</a></i> (1981) starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Caan_(actor)" title="James Caan (actor)">James Caan</a>. His next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_(film)" title="The Keep (film)">The Keep</a></i> (1983) was in retrospect an uncharacteristic choice, being that it is a supernatural thriller set in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> occupied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romania</a>. Though it was a commercial flop, the film has since attained cult status amongst fans.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1986, Mann was the first to bring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Harris" title="Thomas Harris">Thomas Harris</a>'s character of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter" title="Hannibal Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a> to the screen with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhunter_(film)" title="Manhunter (film)">Manhunter</a></i>, his adaptation of novel <i>Red Dragon</i>, which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Cox_(actor)" title="Brian Cox (actor)">Brian Cox</a> as a more down-to-earth Hannibal. The story was remade less than 20 years after it came out by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Ratner" title="Brett Ratner">Brett Ratner</a> presumably because <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Hopkins" title="Anthony Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> reprisal of the role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridley_Scott" title="Ridley Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s <i>Hannibal</i> had made the character a highly lucrative property. In an interview on the <i>Manhunter</i> DVD, star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Petersen" title="William Petersen">William Petersen</a> comments that because Mann is so focused on his creations, it takes several years for Mann to complete a film; Petersen believes that this is why Mann doesn't make films very often.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He gained widespread recognition in 1992 for his film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_of_the_Mohicans_(1992_film)" title="Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)">Last of the Mohicans</a></i>. His biggest critical successes in the 1990s began with the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_(1995_film)" title="Heat (1995 film)">Heat</a></i> in 1995 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(film)" title="The Insider (film)">The Insider</a></i> in 1999. The films, which featured Al Pacino along with Robert DeNiro in <i>Heat</i> and Russell Crowe in <i>The Insider</i>, showcased Mann's cinematic style and adeptness at creating rich, complex storylines as well as directing actors. <i>The Insider</i> was nominated for seven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> as a result, including a nomination for Mann's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">direction</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With his next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_(film)" title="Ali (film)">Ali</a></i> starring Will Smith in 2001, he started experimenting with digital cameras. The film helped catapult <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith" title="Will Smith">Will Smith</a> to greater fame, and he was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for his performance.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(film)" title="Collateral (film)">Collateral</a></i>, he shot all of the exterior scenes digitally so that he could achieve more depth and detail during the night scenes while shooting most of the interiors on film stock.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004, Mann produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aviator" title="The Aviator">The Aviator</a></i>, based on the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, which he had developed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_DiCaprio" title="Leonardo DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. However, Mann demurred doing a second biopic after "Ali", directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collateral_(film)" title="Collateral (film)">Collateral</a></i> starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx and offered the "The Aviator" director's chair to now-frequent DiCaprio collaborator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>. <i>The Aviator</i> was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> for Best Picture but lost to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Million_Dollar_Baby" title="Million Dollar Baby">Million Dollar Baby</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Collateral</i>, Mann directed the film adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice_(film)" title="Miami Vice (film)">Miami Vice</a></i> which he also executive produced.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) packs his belongings and leaves his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_%26_Williamson" title="Brown &amp; Williamson">Brown &amp; Williamson</a> office, returning home to his wife Liane (Venora) and two children, one of whom suffers from acute asthma. When Liane asks about the boxes in Wigandâ€™s car, he reveals that he was fired from his job that morning.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon returning home to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley,_California" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, Bergman receives an anonymous package containing documents relating to tobacco company <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altria_Group" title="Altria Group">Philip Morris</a>, and approaches a friend at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration" title="Food and Drug Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> for the name of someone who can put the information in laymanâ€™s terms. Bergman is referred to Wigand, and calls him at his home, only to be steadfastly rebuffed. Curious with Wigandâ€™s refusal to even speak to him, Bergman eventually convinces him to meet at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seelbach_Hotel" title="Seelbach Hotel">Seelbach Hotel</a> in Louisville.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the privacy of the hotel room, Wigand agrees to interpret and explain the scientific tobacco-related documents, but stresses that he cannot talk about anything else because of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality_agreement" title="Confidentiality agreement">confidentiality agreement</a>. After leaving with the documents, Wigand appears at a meeting with Brown &amp; Williamson <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</a> Thomas Sandefur (Gambon), who orders him to sign an expanded confidentiality agreement, under threat of revoking his severance pay and medical coverage and initiating legal proceedings. Wigand, enraged at the threats and believing that Bergman notified Sandefur about their confidential meeting, calls and accuses Bergman of treachery.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman visits Wigandâ€™s house the next day and maintains that he did not reveal anything to Brown &amp; Williamson. Reassured, Wigand talks to Bergman about the seven CEOs of â€œ<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tobacco" title="Big Tobacco">Big Tobacco</a>â€&#157; perjuring themselves to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">United States Congress</a> about their awareness of nicotineâ€™s addictiveness, and that the CEOs should fear Wigand. Bergman says Wigand has to decide for himself whether to blow the whistle on big tobacco.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman returns to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">Columbia Broadcast System</a> Headquarters in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, where he and Wallace discuss Wigandâ€™s situation and the potential damage he could do to Big Tobacco. A lawyer at the meeting claims that Wigandâ€™s confidentiality agreement, combined with Big Tobaccoâ€™s unlimited checkbook, would effectively silence Wigand under mountains of litigation and massive legal fees. Bergman proposes that Wigand could be compelled to speak through a court order arising from unrelated State litigation against Big Tobacco aimed at recovering Medicare and Medicaid costs arising from tobacco-related illnesses. They conclude this could give Wigand some protection against Brown &amp; Williamson should he do an interview for <i>60 Minutes</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Wigand family move into a newer, more affordable house, and Wigand begins teaching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemistry" title="Chemistry">chemistry</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> at a Louisville high school. One night while asleep, heâ€™s alerted by his daughter to sounds outside the house. Upon investigation, he discovers a fresh shoe print in his newly planted garden, and begins to become paranoid.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>

The trio express an interest in Bergmanâ€™s idea and tell him to have Wigand call them. Meanwhile, Wigand receives death threats via <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email" title="Email">email</a> and finds a bullet in his mailbox, prompting him to contact the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> who, after subtly accusing him of being emotionally unbalanced, confiscate his computer for evidence.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Enraged over the threats to his family, Wigand phones Bergman and demands to fly to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and tape his testimony immediately. During Wigandâ€™s interview with Wallace, Wigand states that Brown &amp; Williamson is making their cigarettes more addictive. He continues by saying Brown &amp; Williamson have consciously ignored public health considerations in the name of profit.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Louisville, Wigand begins his new teaching job and talks to Richard Scruggs. Upon returning home, Wigand discovers that Bergman has given him some security personnel. Wigandâ€™s wife is struggling under the pressure and tells him so. Days later, Wigand travels to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascagoula,_Mississippi" title="Pascagoula, Mississippi">Pascagoula, Mississippi</a>, where he is served a restraining order issued by a State court in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> to prevent him from testifying.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though the restraining order, obtained by Brown &amp; Williamsonâ€™s lawyers, was thrown out in Mississippi, Wigand is threatened with the contention that if he testifies and returns to Kentucky he could be imprisoned for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court" title="Contempt of court">contempt of court</a>. After a lengthy period of introspection, Wigand goes to the Mississippi court and gives his deposition, during which he says nicotine acts as a drug. Following his testimony, Wigand returns to Louisville, where he discovers that his wife and children have left him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At this point the film shifts its emphasis from Wigand to Bergman. Bergman and Wallace go to a meeting with CBS Corporate about the Wigand interview. The applicability of a legal theory has emerged, one known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortious_interference" title="Tortious interference">tortious interference</a>: if two parties have an agreement, such as a confidentiality agreement, and one of those parties is induced by a third party to break that agreement, the third party can be sued by the other parties for any damages. The more truth Wigand tells, the greater the damage, the theory applied goes, and a greater likelihood that CBS will be faced by a multi-billion dollar lawsuit from Brown &amp; Williamson. It is later suggested that an edited interview take the place of the original. Bergman vehemently disagrees, and claims that the reason CBS Corporate is leaning on CBS News to edit the interview is because they fear that the prospect of a multi-billion dollar lawsuit could jeopardize the sale of CBS to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westinghouse_Electric_Corporation_(1886)" title="Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)">Westinghouse</a>. Wallace and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hewitt" title="Don Hewitt">Don Hewitt</a> agree to edit the interview, leaving Bergman alone in the stance of airing it uncensored.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A PR firm hired by Big Tobacco initiates a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smear_campaign" title="Smear campaign">smear campaign</a> against Wigand, dredging up details about his life and publishing a 500-page <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dossier" title="Dossier">dossier</a>. Through Wigand, Bergman discovers that Big Tobacco have distorted and exaggerated numerous claims, and convinces a reporter from the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal">Wall Street Journal</a></i> to delay the story until it can be disproven. Bergman contacts several private investigators who do begin their own investigation. Bergman releases his findings to the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter and tells him to push the deadline. Meanwhile, due to his constant fights with CBS management, Bergman is ordered to go on "vacation" (which is really a suspension).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bergman tells Wigand that he is important to a lot of people and tries to assure Wigand that he is doing the right thing by offering that "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero" title="Hero">heroes</a> like him are in short supply". After hanging up, Bergman contacts <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> and reveals the scandal that occurred at <i>60 Minutes</i>, after which the <i>Times</i> publishes a scathing article that accuses CBS of betraying the legacy of their famous reporter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_R._Murrow" title="Edward R. Murrow">Edward R. Murrow</a> for bowing to such attempts to silence publication of a truthful news story. Meanwhile, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> exonerates Wigand and reveals his deposition in Mississippi, while condemning Big Tobaccoâ€™s 500-page smear as â€œthe lowest form of character assassination.â€&#157; <i>60 Minutes</i> finally broadcasts the full interview with Wigand.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the final scene, Bergman talks to Wallace and he tells him that despite their finally airing the piece, he is still quitting, saying, â€œWhat got broken here doesnâ€™t go back together again.â€&#157; The final shot is of him leaving the building. A series of title cards appear stating that a $246 billion settlement was made by tobacco companies with Mississippi and other States in their lawsuit and that Wigand lives in South Carolina. In 1996, Dr. Wigand won the Sallie Mae First Class Teacher of the Year award, receiving national recognition for his teaching skills.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Mann was in post-production on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_(1995_film)" title="Heat (1995 film)">Heat</a></i>, Bergman was going through the events depicted in <i>The Insider</i>. Bergman discussed his trials and tribulations with Mann. The director knew of Bergmanâ€™s reputation as a man of his word and was intrigued. They had met in 1989 and talked about a few projects but nothing happened. Over the years, the two men kept in touch, talking about Bergmanâ€™s experiences and at one point Mann was interested in doing a movie on an arms merchant in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marbella" title="Marbella">Marbella</a> that Bergman knew. Mann first conceived of what would become <i>The Insider</i> (then known only as â€œThe Untitled Tobacco Projectâ€&#157;) between the Wigand-lite aired interview in November 1995 and February 1996, when the segment aired in its entirety and Bergman was asked to leave <i>60 Minutes</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With a budget set at $68 million, Mann began collecting a massive amount of documents to research the events depicted in the film: depositions, news reports and <i>60 Minutes</i> transcripts. He had read a screenplay that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roth" title="Eric Roth">Eric Roth</a> had written, called <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good_Shepherd_(film)" title="The Good Shepherd (film)"><i>The Good Shepherd</i></a>, about the first 25 years of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>. Based on this script, Mann approached Roth to help him co-write <i>The Insider</i>. Mann and Roth wrote several outlines together and talked about the structure of the story. Roth interviewed Bergman numerous times for research and the two men became friends. After he and Mann wrote the first draft together, at the bar at the Broadway Deli in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a>, Roth met Wigand. The whistle blower was still under his confidentiality agreement and would not break it for Roth or Mann. Roth remembered his first impressions of Wigand were that he came across as unlikable and defensive. As they continued to write more drafts, the two men made minor adjustments in chronology and invented some extraneous dialogue but also stuck strictly to the facts whenever possible. However, Mann and Roth were not interested in making a documentary.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Kilmer" title="Val Kilmer">Val Kilmer</a> was considered by Mann for the role of Jeffrey Wigand. Producer Pieter Jan Brugge suggested Russell Crowe and after seeing him in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._Confidential_(film)" title="L.A. Confidential (film)">L.A. Confidential</a></i>, Mann flew Crowe down from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> where he was in the middle of filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery,_Alaska" title="Mystery, Alaska">Mystery, Alaska</a></i> on the actorâ€™s one day off and had him read scenes from <i>The Insider</i> screenplay for two to three hours. When Crowe read the scene where Wigand finds out that the <i>60 Minutes</i> interview he did will not be aired, he captured the essence of Wigand so well that Mann knew he had found the perfect actor for the role. Crowe, who was only 33 years old at the time, was apprehensive at playing someone much older than himself when there were so many good actors in that age range. Once Crowe was cast, he and Mann spent six weeks together before shooting began, talking about his character and his props, clothes and accessories. Crowe put on 35 pounds for the role, shaved back his hairline, bleached his hair seven times and had a daily application of wrinkles and liver spots to his skin to transform himself into Wigand (who was in his early-to-mid-50s during the events depicted in the film). Crowe was not able to talk to Wigand about his experiences because he was still bound to his confidentiality agreement during much of filmâ€™s development period. To get a handle on the manâ€™s voice and how he talked, Crowe listened repeatedly to a six-hour tape of Wigand.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Al Pacino was Mannâ€™s only choice to play Lowell Bergman. He wanted to see the actor play a role that he had never seen him do in a movie before. Pacino, who had worked with Mann previously in <i>Heat</i>, was more than willing to take on the role. To research for the film, Mann and Pacino hung out with reporters from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine, spent time with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News" title="ABC News">ABC News</a> and Pacino actually met Bergman to help get in character.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pacino suggested Mann to cast Christopher Plummer in the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Wallace_(journalist)" title="Mike Wallace (journalist)">Mike Wallace</a>. Pacino had seen the veteran actor on the stage many times and was a big fan of Plummerâ€™s work. Mann had also wanted to work with Plummer since the 1970s. Pacino told Mann to watch Plummer in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Lumet" title="Sidney Lumet">Sidney Lumet</a>â€™s <i>Stage Struck</i> (1958) and afterwards he was the directorâ€™s only choice to play Wallaceâ€”Plummer did not have to audition. He met with Mann and after several discussions was cast in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wigand requested a ban on cigarettes in the film. However, as the character Wigand enters the airport, shortly before receiving his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena" title="Subpoena">subpoena</a>, a woman in the background is seen smoking a cigarette, also, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon" title="Lebanon">Lebanese</a> soldier seen smoking briefly while Bergman is being transported to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezbollah" title="Hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> meeting site.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The courtroom where Wigand gives his deposition is not a set. The filmmakers used the actual courtroom in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascagoula,_Mississippi" title="Pascagoula, Mississippi">Pascagoula, Mississippi</a> where the real Wigandâ€™s deposition was given.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During a scene where Pacino and Crowe are speaking in a parked car, a large clockface can be seen in the background. This is actually the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colgate_Clock_(Indiana)" title="Colgate Clock (Indiana)">Colgate Clock</a>, located on the faÃ§ade of the Colgate factory in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarksville,_Indiana" title="Clarksville, Indiana">Clarksville, Indiana</a>, directly across the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky" title="Louisville, Kentucky">Louisville, Kentucky</a>, where the majority of the film was shot.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Trouble began before <i>The Insider</i> was even released. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Hewitt" title="Don Hewitt">Don Hewitt</a> and Wallace accused Mann of extreme dramatic license and working with Bergman to transform him into a hero at the expense of the two men. They also said that Bergman negotiated a movie deal with Mann while the case was still going on. They claimed that Bergman was frequently on the phone with Mann and took notes during all CBS meetings. Wallace, in particular, was upset that the film would not portray him in the most flattering way. He had read an early draft of the screenplay and objected to how quickly he changed his mind and publicly criticized CBS. Mann and Roth agreed to make some changes. Despite revisions, Wallace continued to voice his concerns in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brill%27s_Content" title="Brill's Content">Brillâ€™s Content</a></i> that he would be portrayed unfairly in the movie.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>The Insider</i> was released, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_and_Williamson" title="Brown and Williamson">Brown and Williamson</a> accused the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Company" title="Walt Disney Company">Walt Disney Company</a> of distorting the truth. They took out a full-page ad in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal" title="The Wall Street Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> to counter promotional appearances Wigand and those associated with the film were doing. The tobacco company also had representatives at screenings in eight cities handing out cards asking patrons to call a toll-free number that would answer questions about the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brown and Williamson sent at least one cautionary letter to Disney concerning <i>The Insider</i> without having seen the film. Their problems with the movie came from two scenes: one where Wigand finds a bullet in his mailbox with a threatening note and a scene where Wigand is trailed by a menacing figure at a golf range. Wigand actually reported the first event, while Mann has acknowledged that the second scene was in fact fictional and created for dramatic effect, although according to the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> article on which the movie is based, there were other death threats on Wigand not detailed in the movie.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Insider</i> was released in 1,809 theaters on November 5, 1999 where it grossed a total of $6,712,361 on its opening weekend and ranked fourth in the country for that time period. It went on to make $29.1 million in North America and $31.2 million in the rest of the world for a total of $60.3 million worldwide, significantly lower than its $90 million budget. The film was considered to be a commercial disappointment. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney" title="Disney">Disney</a> executives had hoped that Mann's film would have the same commercial and critical success as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_President%27s_Men_(film)" title="All the President's Men (film)">All the President's Men</a></i>, a film in the same vein. However, <i>The Insider</i> had limited appeal to younger moviegoers (studio executives reportedly said the prime audience was over the age of 40.) and the subject matter was "not notably dramatic", according to marketing executives. Then-Disney chairman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Roth" title="Joe Roth">Joe Roth</a> said, "It's like walking up a hill with a refrigerator on your back. The fact of the matter is we're really proud we did this movie. People say it's the best movie they've seen this year. They say, 'Why don't we make more movies like this?'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Insider</i> received near-unanimous praise, garnering some of the best reviews of 1999 and of Michael Mannâ€™s career. It holds a 96% â€œfreshâ€&#157; rating at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> based on 127 reviews and an 84 metascore on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> gave the film three and half out of four stars and praised â€œits power to absorb, entertain, and angerâ€&#157;. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> magazine's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ansen" title="David Ansen">David Ansen</a> wrote, "Mann could probably make a movie about needlepoint riveting. Employing a big canvas, a huge cast of superb character actors and his always exquisite eye for composition, he's made the kind of current-events epic that Hollywood has largely abandoned to TV--and shows us how movies can do it better". In her review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Maslin" title="Janet Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> praised Russell Crowe as â€œa subtle powerhouse in his wrenching evocation of Wigand, takes on the thick, stolid look of the man he portraysâ€&#157;, and felt that it was â€œby far Mannâ€™s most fully realized and enthralling workâ€&#157;. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "When Crowe gets to command the screen, <i>The Insider</i> comes to roiled life. It's an <i>All the President's Men</i> in which Deep Throat takes center stage, an insider prodded to spill the truth". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Travers" title="Peter Travers">Peter Travers</a> wrote, â€œWith its dynamite performances, strafing wit and dramatic provocation, <i>The Insider</i> offers Mann at his best--blood up, unsanitized, and unbowedâ€&#157;. However, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> gave the film a "B" rating and felt that it "a good but far from great movie because it presents truth telling in America as far more imperiled than it is".</p>
