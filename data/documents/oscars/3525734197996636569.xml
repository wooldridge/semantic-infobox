	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1987, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minneapolis" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> automobile salesman Jerry Lundegaard (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Macy" title="William H.

After being introduced to criminals Carl Showalter (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Buscemi" title="Steve Buscemi">Steve Buscemi</a>) and Gaear Grimsrud (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Stormare" title="Peter Stormare">Peter Stormare</a>) by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native American</a> ex-convict Shep Proudfoot (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Steve_Reevis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Steve Reevis (page does not exist)">Steve Reevis</a>), a mechanic at his dealership, Jerry travels to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo,_North_Dakota" title="Fargo, North Dakota">Fargo, North Dakota</a> and hires the two men to kidnap his wife Jean (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kristin_Rudr%C3%BCd&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Kristin RudrÃ¼d (page does not exist)">Kristin RudrÃ¼d</a>) in exchange for a new car and half of the $80,000 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransom" title="Ransom">ransom</a>. However, Jerry intends to demand a much larger sum from his wealthy but antagonistic father-in-law, Wade Gustafson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harve_Presnell" title="Harve Presnell">Harve Presnell</a>), and keep most of the money for himself.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, a financial company has been threatening to withdraw a loan they made to Jerry, and Jerry has been trying to raise money by promoting a real-estate deal to Wade. Jerry tries to call off the kidnapping after Wade agrees to the investment, but he is too late, and, as it turns out, Wade intends to buy the property himself, leaving Jerry with only a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder%27s_fee" title="Finder's fee">finder's fee</a>, which is not enough to pay off his debts.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean, but on their way through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainerd,_Minnesota" title="Brainerd, Minnesota">Brainerd</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota_State_Patrol" title="Minnesota State Patrol">state trooper</a> stops them because of the car's license plates. When Carl's attempt to bribe the trooper fails, Gaear shoots the trooper. He also kills a couple who happen to drive by and see Carl dragging the trooper's body.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The deaths are investigated the next morning by local police chief Marge Gunderson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_McDormand" title="Frances McDormand">McDormand</a>), who is seven months pregnant. She quickly deduces the chain of events and follows the leads that arise, interviewing two prostitutes who serviced the criminals and tracing the license plates on the criminals' vehicle to Jerry's dealership. After being informed that they telephoned Shep Proudfoot, she drives to Minneapolis, but she acquires no information in interviews with Shep and Jerry.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, Jerry contacts Wade, claiming that the kidnappers insist on dealing only with Jerry. Wade accepts this arrangement at first, but later changes his mind. When he meets with Carl at a parking garage, he refuses to give him the money until his daughter is returned. Angered by his demands and unexpected appearance, Carl starts a shootout and kills Wade after Wade shoots him in the face, then kills the garage attendant on his way out. Jerry arrives at the scene after Carl leaves, and opens the trunk of his car, presumably to take Wade's body. On his way to the backwoods hideout on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moose_Lake_Township,_Cass_County,_Minnesota" title="Moose Lake Township, Cass County, Minnesota">Moose Lake</a>, Carl discovers that the bag he took from Wade contains a million dollars and buries most of the money by the side of the highway. At the hideout, Gaear has killed Jean, and, in a dispute over the car, he kills Carl with an axe.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before leaving town, Marge questions Jerry again, asking him about the car used in the murders. He provides no information, but when she asks him to check the lot for missing cars, he flees the dealership. Marge phones the State Police to find and arrest him, then, following up on a tip, she drives to the lake, sees the kidnappers' car, and arrives at the hideout just in time to see Gaear pushing the last of Carl's body into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_chipper" title="Wood chipper">wood chipper</a>. Gaear tries to flee, but Marge shoots him in the leg and arrests him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jerry is later arrested in a motel outside of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bismarck,_North_Dakota" title="Bismarck, North Dakota">Bismarck, North Dakota</a>. In the final scene, Marge and her husband, Norm (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carroll_Lynch" title="John Carroll Lynch">John Carroll Lynch</a>), sit in bed together discussing his artwork, which has been selected as the design for a postage stamp.</p>

According to the film's dialect coach, Liz Himelstein, "the accent was another character". She coached the cast using audio tapes and field trips. Another dialog coach, Larissa Kokernot (who appeared onscreen playing a prostitute), notes that the "small-town, Minnesota accent is close to the sound of the Nords and the Swedes", which is "where the musicality comes from". She also helped McDormand understand Minnesota nice and the practice of head-nodding to show agreement. Most rural Minnesotans speak with an accent similar to that found in the film, but the strong accent of Jerry and Marge is less common in the Twin Cities, where over 60% of the state's population lives. Speakers from Minneapolis and St. Paul are more characterized by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Cities_Vowel_Shift" title="Northern Cities Vowel Shift">Northern Cities Vowel Shift</a>, which is also found in other places in the northern United States such as Chicago, Detroit and Buffalo.</p>
