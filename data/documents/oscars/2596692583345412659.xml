	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen was born and raised in New York City, the son of Nettie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Cherrie; November 8, 1906 â€“ January 27, 2002), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookkeeper" title="Bookkeeper">bookkeeper</a> at her familyâ€™s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicatessen" title="Delicatessen">delicatessen</a>, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 â€“ January 13, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jew" title="Jew">Jewish</a> and his grandparents were immigrants who spoke <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yiddish" title="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> and German; both of his parents were born and raised on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_East_Side" title="Lower East Side">Lower East Side</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. Allen has a sister, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letty_Aronson" title="Letty Aronson">Letty</a>, who was born in 1943 and raised in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwood,_Brooklyn" title="Midwood, Brooklyn">Midwood</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>. His childhood was not particularly happy: his parents did not get along, and he had a rocky relationship with his stern, temperamental mother. Allen spoke Yiddish during his early years and, after attending <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_school" title="Hebrew school">Hebrew school</a> for eight years, went to Public School 99 (now The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> School for Science and Literature) and to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwood_High_School" title="Midwood High School">Midwood High School</a>. During that time, he lived in an apartment at 1402 Avenue K, between East 14th and 15th Streets. He impressed students with his extraordinary talent at card and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_trick" title="Magic trick">magic tricks</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To raise money he began writing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke" title="Joke">gags</a> for the agent David O. Alber, who sold them to newspaper <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnist" title="Columnist">columnists</a>. According to Allen, his first published joke read: â€œWoody Allen says he ate at a restaurant that had O.P.S. prices â€“ over peopleâ€™s salaries.â€&#157;</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He began to call himself Woody Allen. He was an extremely talented young comedian and would later joke that when he was young he was often sent to inter-faith <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_camps" title="Summer camps">summer camps</a>, where he â€œwas savagely beaten by children of all races and creeds.â€&#157; At the age of 17, he legally changed his name to Heywood Allen.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After high school, he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a> (NYU), where he studied communication and film. He was never a committed student: he failed a film course and was eventually expelled. He later briefly attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York" title="City College of New York">City College of New York</a> and eventually taught at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_School" title="The New School">The New School</a>. He also studied with writing teacher <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lajos_Egri" title="Lajos Egri">Lajos Egri</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his false starts at NYU and City College, he became a full-time writer for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Shriner" title="Herb Shriner">Herb Shriner</a>, earning $75 a week at first. At the age of 19, he started writing scripts for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tonight_Show#Steve_Allen_.281954.E2.80.931957.29" title="The Tonight Show">The Tonight Show</a></i>, specials for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Caesar" title="Sid Caesar">Sid Caesar</a> post-<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Hour" title="Caesar's Hour">Caesar's Hour</a></i> (1954â€“1957), and other television shows. By the time he was working for Caesar, he was making $1500 a week; with Caesar he worked alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Simon" title="Danny Simon">Danny Simon</a>, whom Allen credits for helping him to form his writing style.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961, he started a new career as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy" title="Stand-up comedy">stand-up comedian</a>, debuting in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> club called the Duplex. Examples of Allenâ€™s standup act can be heard on the albums <i>Standup Comic</i> and <i>Nightclub Years 1964â€“1968</i> (including his classic routine entitled â€œThe Mooseâ€&#157;).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen wrote for the popular <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candid_Camera" title="Candid Camera">Candid Camera</a></i> television show, and appeared in some episodes. Together with his managers, Allen developed a neurotic, nervous, and intellectual persona for his stand-up routine, a successful move which secured regular gigs for him in nightclubs and on television.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen started writing short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i>; he was particularly inspired by the tradition of four prominent <i>New Yorker</i>â€™s humorists, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._J._Perelman" title="S. J. Perelman">S. J. Perelman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_S._Kaufman" title="George S. Kaufman">George S.

Allen is also an accomplished author having published four collections of his short pieces and plays. These are <i>Getting Even,</i> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_Feathers" title="Without Feathers">Without Feathers</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_Effects" title="Side Effects">Side Effects</a></i> and <i>Mere Anarchy.</i> His early comic fiction was heavily influenced by the zany, pun-ridden humour of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.J._Perelman" title="S.J. Perelman">S.J. Perelman</a>. Allen brought significant innovation to the comedy <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monologue" title="Monologue">monologue</a> genre and his stand-up comedy is considered highly influential.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He also became a successful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> playwright and wrote <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Drink_the_Water_(play)" title="Don't Drink the Water (play)">Don't Drink the Water</a></i> in 1966. It starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Jacobi" title="Lou Jacobi">Lou Jacobi</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Medford" title="Kay Medford">Kay Medford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Gillette" title="Anita Gillette">Anita Gillette</a> and Allenâ€™s future movie co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Roberts_(actor)" title="Tony Roberts (actor)">Anthony Roberts</a>. A film adaptation of the play, directed by Howard Morris, was released in 1969 starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Gleason" title="Jackie Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a>. Because he was not particularly happy with the (1969) film version of his play, in 1994 Allen directed and starred in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Drink_the_Water_(film)" title="Don't Drink the Water (film)">third version</a> for television, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Fox" title="Michael J.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The next play Allen wrote that was produced on Broadway was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_Again,_Sam" title="Play It Again, Sam">Play It Again, Sam</a></i>, which he also starred in. The play opened on February 12, 1969, and ran for 453 performances. It also featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a> and Anthony Roberts. Allen, Keaton and Roberts would reprise their roles in the film version of the play, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ross" title="Herbert Ross">Herbert Ross</a>. For its March 21 issue, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a></i> featured Allen on its cover.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All of Allenâ€™s early films were <i>formless comedies</i> like those of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Brothers" title="Marx Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>. As all pure comedies, they needed only a thin plot, and were constituted entirely of comic inventions, a non-stop sequence of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_gag" title="Visual gag">sight gags</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-liner_joke" title="One-liner joke">one-liners</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first movie production was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_New,_Pussycat%3F" title="What's New, Pussycat?">What's New, Pussycat?</a></i> in 1965, for which he wrote the initial screenplay. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> hired him to re-write a script and to appear in a small part in the movie. Over the course of the re-write, Beattyâ€™s role was lessened and Allenâ€™s increased. Beatty was upset and quit the production. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> was hired for the Beatty role, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> was brought in as well; Sellers was a big enough star to demand many of Woody Allenâ€™s best lines/scenes, prompting hasty re-writes. Because of this experience, Allen realized the importance of having control of his own writing. Despite that fact that most of his movies do not gross well and the fact that due to the small amounts of money his producers are able to raise he asks his actors to work for far less than what they would normally be paid, Allen remains one of a handful of writers and directors who has been able to maintain complete control over his own work.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allenâ€™s first directorial effort was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_Up,_Tiger_Lily%3F" title="What's Up, Tiger Lily?">What's Up, Tiger Lily?</a></i> (1966, co-written with Mickey Rose), in which an existing Japanese spy movie <i>(Kokusai himitsu keisatsu: Kagi no kagi</i> [1965] â€” â€œInternational Secret Police: Key of Keysâ€&#157;) was redubbed in English by Allen and his friends with entirely new, comic dialogue.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He acted in the James Bond spoof, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino_Royale_(1967_film)" title="Casino Royale (1967 film)">Casino Royale</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Take_the_Money_and_Run" title="Take the Money and Run">Take the Money and Run</a></i> in 1969. That same year he starred in his own TV special, <i>The Woody Allen Special.</i> On the show he performed standup comedy routines before a live audience and acted in a sketch with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candace_Bergen" title="Candace Bergen">Candace Bergen</a> in which they appeared nude but their bodies were kept hidden from view by the camera. The special also had guest appearances by the pop vocal group <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_5th_Dimension" title="The 5th Dimension">The 5th Dimension</a> singing their hit singles â€œWorkinâ€™ On A Groovy Thingâ€&#157; and â€œ<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedding_Bell_Blues" title="Wedding Bell Blues">Wedding Bell Blues</a>â€&#157;. The showâ€™s sponsor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libby%27s" title="Libby's">Libby's</a>, broadcast comical commercials starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Randall" title="Tony Randall">Tony Randall</a> as a detective.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From 1971 to 1975 Allen directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bananas_(film)" title="Bananas (film)">Bananas</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_You_Always_Wanted_to_Know_About_Sex*_(*But_Were_Afraid_to_Ask)" title="Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)">Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_(film)" title="Sleeper (film)">Sleeper</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Death" title="Love and Death">Love and Death</a></i>. <i>Take the Money and Run</i> and <i>Bananas</i> were co-written by his childhood friend, Mickey Rose.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his initial pure comedies in the tradition of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx_Brothers" title="Marx Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>, Allen switched to sophisticated <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lubitsch" title="Lubitsch">Lubitsch</a>-like comedies, adding a plot and reducing the comic inventions. Allen settled on this genre for his subsequent career. In 1972, he wrote and starred in the film version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_Again,_Sam_(1972_film)" title="Play It Again, Sam (1972 film)">Play It Again, Sam</a></i>, which was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Ross" title="Herbert Ross">Herbert Ross</a>. In 1976, he starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Front" title="The Front">The Front</a></i> (directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Ritt" title="Martin Ritt">Martin Ritt</a>) a humorous and poignant account of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacklist" title="Blacklist">blacklisting</a> during the 1950s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i> won four Academy Awards in 1977, including Best Picture and Best Actress in a Leading Role for Diane Keaton. <i>Annie Hall</i> set the standard for modern romantic comedy and also started a minor fashion trend with the unique clothes worn by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a> in the film (the masculine clothing, such as ties with cardigans, was actually Keatonâ€™s own). While in production, its working title was â€œ<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia" title="Anhedonia">Anhedonia</a>â€&#157;, a term that means the inability to feel pleasure and its plot revolved around a murder mystery. Apparently the murder mystery plot did not work (and was later used in his 1993 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Murder_Mystery" title="Manhattan Murder Mystery">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a></i>), so Allen re-cut the movie after production ended to focus on the romantic comedy between Allenâ€™s character, Alvy Singer, and Keatonâ€™s character, Annie Hall. The new version, retitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i> (named after Keaton, Hall being her given last name and Annie a nickname), still deals with the theme of the inability to feel pleasure. The film is ranked at No. 35 on the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a></i>â€™s â€œ100 Best Moviesâ€&#157; and at No. 4 on the AFI list of â€œ100 Best Comediesâ€&#157;.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a>,</i> released in 1979, is a black-and-white film that can be viewed as an homage to New York City. As in many other Allen films, the protagonists are upper-class academics. Even though it makes fun of pretentious intellectuals, the story is packed with obscure references which makes it less accessible to a general audience. The love-hate opinion of cerebral persons found in <i>Manhattan</i> is characteristic of many of Allenâ€™s movies including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a>.</i> <i>Manhattan</i> focuses on the complicated relationship between a middle-aged Isaac Davis (Allen) and a 17-year-old Tracy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariel_Hemingway" title="Mariel Hemingway">Mariel Hemingway</a>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Hall" title="Annie Hall">Annie Hall</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i>, Allen wrote and directed the gloomy drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interiors" title="Interiors">Interiors</a></i> (1978), in the style of the late <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swedish_people" title="Swedish people">Swedish</a> director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, one of Allen's chief influences. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interiors" title="Interiors">Interiors</a></i> represented a significant departure from Allenâ€™s â€œearlier, funnier comediesâ€&#157; (a line from 1980â€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" title="Stardust Memories">Stardust Memories</a></i>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allenâ€™s 1980s films, even the comedies, have somber and philosophical undertones. Some, like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_(film)" title="September (film)">September</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" title="Stardust Memories">Stardust Memories</a></i>, are influenced by the works of European directors, notably <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini" title="Federico Fellini">Federico Fellini</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" title="Stardust Memories">Stardust Memories</a></i> features Sandy Bates, a successful filmmaker played by Allen, who expresses resentment and scorn for his fans. Overcome by the recent death of a friend from illness, the character states, â€œI donâ€™t want to make funny movies any moreâ€&#157; and a running gag has various people (including a group of visiting space aliens) telling Bates that they appreciate his films, â€œespecially the early, funny ones.â€&#157; Allen believes this to be one of his best films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the mid-1980s, Allen had begun to combine tragic and comic elements with the release of such films as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_and_Her_Sisters" title="Hannah and Her Sisters">Hannah and Her Sisters</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimes_and_Misdemeanors" title="Crimes and Misdemeanors">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a></i>, in which he tells two stories that connect at the end. He also produced a vividly idiosyncratic tragi-comical parody of documentary, titled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelig" title="Zelig">Zelig</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He made three films about show business; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_Danny_Rose" title="Broadway Danny Rose">Broadway Danny Rose</a></i>, in which he plays a New York show business agent, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Purple_Rose_of_Cairo" title="The Purple Rose of Cairo">The Purple Rose of Cairo</a></i>, a movie that shows the importance of the cinema during the Depression through the character of the naive Cecilia, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Days" title="Radio Days">Radio Days</a></i>, which is a film about his childhood in Brooklyn and the importance of the radio. <i>Purple Rose</i> was named by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Magazine" title="Time Magazine">Time Magazine</a></i> as one of the 100 best films of all time and Allen has described it as one of his three best films, along with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_Memories" title="Stardust Memories">Stardust Memories</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_Point" title="Match Point">Match Point</a>.</i> (Allen defines them as â€œbestâ€&#157; not in terms of quality but because they came out the closest to his original vision.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the end of the â€˜80s, he made other movies that were inspired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>â€™s films. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_(film)" title="September (film)">September</a></i> resembles <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Sonata" title="Autumn Sonata">Autumn Sonata</a></i> and Allen uses many elements from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Strawberries_(film)" title="Wild Strawberries (film)">Wild Strawberries</a></i> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Woman" title="Another Woman">Another Woman</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His 1992 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_and_Fog" title="Shadows and Fog">Shadows and Fog</a></i> is a black-and-white homage to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Expressionism" title="German Expressionism">German expressionists</a> and features the music of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Weill" title="Kurt Weill">Kurt Weill</a>. Allen then made his critically acclaimed drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Husbands_and_Wives" title="Husbands and Wives">Husbands and Wives</a></i> (1992), which received two Oscar nominations: Best Supporting Actress for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Davis" title="Judy Davis">Judy Davis</a> and Best Original Screenplay for Allen. His film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Murder_Mystery" title="Manhattan Murder Mystery">Manhattan Murder Mystery</a></i> (1993) combined suspense with dark comedy and marked the return of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Alda" title="Alan Alda">Alan Alda</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anjelica_Huston" title="Anjelica Huston">Anjelica Huston</a>.</p>

The singing and dancing scenes in <i>Everyone Says I Love You</i> are similar to many musicals starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Astaire" title="Fred Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>. The comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Aphrodite" title="Mighty Aphrodite">Mighty Aphrodite</a></i> (1995), in which Greek drama plays a large role, won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mira_Sorvino" title="Mira Sorvino">Mira Sorvino</a>. Allenâ€™s 1999 jazz-based comedy-drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_and_Lowdown" title="Sweet and Lowdown">Sweet and Lowdown</a></i> was also nominated for two Academy Awards for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn" title="Sean Penn">Sean Penn</a> (Best Actor) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Morton" title="Samantha Morton">Samantha Morton</a> (Best Supporting Actress). In contrast to these lighter movies, Allen veered into darker satire towards the end of the decade with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deconstructing_Harry" title="Deconstructing Harry">Deconstructing Harry</a></i> (1997) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity_(film)" title="Celebrity (film)">Celebrity</a></i> (1998). Allen made his only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> â€œappearanceâ€&#157; to date (2009) via telephone on the show <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Shoot_Me!" title="Just Shoot Me!">Just Shoot Me!</a></i> in a 1997 episode, â€œMy Dinner with Woodyâ€&#157; which paid tribute to several of his films. Allen also provided the lead voice in the 1998 animated film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antz" title="Antz">Antz</a></i>, which featured many actors he had worked with and had Allen play a character that was similar to his earlier neurotic roles.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Time_Crooks" title="Small Time Crooks">Small Time Crooks</a></i> (2000) was his first film with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> studio and represented a change in direction: Allen began giving more interviews and made an attempt to return to his slapstick roots. <i>Small Time Crooks</i> was a relative financial success, grossing over $17 million domestically but Allenâ€™s next four films floundered at the box office, including Allenâ€™s most expensive film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Curse_of_the_Jade_Scorpion" title="The Curse of the Jade Scorpion">The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</a></i> (with a budget of $26 million). <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Ending" title="Hollywood Ending">Hollywood Ending</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anything_Else" title="Anything Else">Anything Else</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_and_Melinda" title="Melinda and Melinda">Melinda and Melinda</a></i> were given â€œrottenâ€&#157; ratings from film-review website <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and each earned less than $5 million domestically. Some critics claimed that Allenâ€™s films since 1999â€™s <i>Sweet and Lowdown</i> were subpar and expressed concern that Allenâ€™s best years were now behind him. Others have been less harsh; reviewing the little-liked <i>Melinda and Melinda</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> wrote, â€œI cannot escape the suspicion that if Woody had never made a previous film, if each new one was Woodyâ€™s Sundance debut, it would get a better reception. His reputation is not a dead shark but an albatross, which with admirable economy Allen has arranged for the critics to carry around their own necks.â€&#157; Woody gave his godson Quincy Rose a small part in <i>Melinda and Melinda</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Match_Point" title="Match Point">Match Point</a></i> (2005) was one of Allenâ€™s most successful films in the past 10 years and generally received very positive reviews.

It is also markedly darker than Allenâ€™s first four films with DreamWorks SKG. In <i>Match Point</i>, Allen shifts his focus from the intellectual upper class of New York to the moneyed upper class of London. It earned more than $23 million domestically (more than any of his films in nearly 20 years) and over $62 million in international box office sales. <i>Match Point</i> earned Allen his first Academy Award nomination since 1998 for Best Writing â€“ Original Screenplay and also earned directing and writing nominations at the Golden Globes, his first Globe nominations since 1987. In an interview with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_Magazine" title="Premiere Magazine">Premiere Magazine</a></i>, Allen stated this was the best film he has ever made.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen returned to London to film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoop_(2006_film)" title="Scoop (2006 film)">Scoop</a></i>, which also starred Johansson, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Jackman" title="Hugh Jackman">Hugh Jackman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McShane" title="Ian McShane">Ian McShane</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_McNally" title="Kevin McNally">Kevin McNally</a> and Allen himself (which remains to be the last film Allen has acted in).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After finishing his third London film, Allen headed to Spain.

PenÃ©lope Cruz received the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen has said that he â€œsurvivesâ€&#157; on the European market. Audiences there have tended to be more receptive to Allenâ€™s films, particularly in Spain, France and Italy; countries where he has a large audience (something joked about in <i>Hollywood Ending</i>). â€œIn the United States things have changed a lot, and itâ€™s hard to make good small films nowâ€&#157;, Allen said in a 2004 interview. â€œThe avaricious studios couldnâ€™t care less about good films â€“ if they get a good film theyâ€™re twice as happy but money-making films are their goal. They only want these $100 million pictures that make $500 million.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 2008, he began filming for a movie focused more towards older audiences starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_David" title="Larry David">Larry David</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patricia_Clarkson" title="Patricia Clarkson">Patricia Clarkson</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Rachel_Wood" title="Evan Rachel Wood">Evan Rachel Wood</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Woody Allen has won three Academy Awards and been nominated a total of 21 times: 14 as a screenwriter, six as a director, and one as an actor. He has more screenwriting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations than any other writer; all are in the â€œBest Original Screenplayâ€&#157; category. He is tied for fifth all-time with six Best Director nominations. His actors have regularly received both nominations and Academy Awards for their work in Allen films, particularly in the Best Supporting categories.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Annie Hall</i> won four Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Actress).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite friendly recognition from the Academy, Allen has consistently refused to attend the ceremony or acknowledge his Oscar wins.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although best known for his films, Allen has also enjoyed a very successful career in theater, starting as early as 1960 when Allen was writing sketches for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue" title="Revue">revue</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_A_to_Z" title="From A to Z">From A to Z</a></i>.

His success continued with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_it_Again,_Sam" title="Play it Again, Sam">Play it Again, Sam</a></i>, which opened in 1969, starring Allen and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a>. The show played for 453 performances and was nominated for three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards" title="Tony Awards">Tony Awards</a>, although none of the nominations were for Allenâ€™s writing or acting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the â€˜70s, Allen wrote a number of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-act_play" title="One-act play">one-act plays</a>, most notably <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_(play)" title="God (play)">God</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_(play)" title="Death (play)">Death</a></i>, which were published in his 1975 collection <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Without_Feathers" title="Without Feathers">Without Feathers</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1981, Allenâ€™s play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Floating_Light_Bulb" title="The Floating Light Bulb">The Floating Light Bulb</a></i> opened on Broadway.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a long hiatus from the stage, Allen returned to the theater in 1995 with the one-act <i>Central Park West</i>, an installment in an evening of theater known as <i>Death Defying Acts</i> that was also made up of new work by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Mamet" title="David Mamet">David Mamet</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_May" title="Elaine May">Elaine May</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the next couple of years, Allen had no direct involvement with the stage, yet notable productions of his work were being staged. A production of <i>God</i> was staged at The Bank of Brazil Cultural Center in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, and theatrical adaptations of Allenâ€™s films <i>Bullets over Broadway</i> and <i>September</i> were produced in Italy and France, respectively, without Allenâ€™s involvement.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, Allen finally returned to the stage with <i>Writerâ€™s Block</i>, an evening of two one-acts â€“ <i>Old Saybrook</i> and <i>Riverside Drive</i> â€“ that played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway" title="Off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a>. The production marked the stage-directing debut for Allen. The production sold out its entire run.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also that year, reports of Allen writing the book for a musical based on <i>Bullets over Broadway</i> surfaced, but no show ever formulated. In 2004, Allenâ€™s first full-length play since 1981, <i>A Second Hand Memory</i>, was directed by Allen and enjoyed an extended run off-Broadway.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In June 2007, it was announced that Allen would make two more creative debuts in the theater, directing a work that he didnâ€™t write and directing an opera â€“ a re-interpretation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Puccini" title="Giacomo Puccini">Puccini's</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Schicchi" title="Gianni Schicchi">Gianni Schicchi</a></i> for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Opera" title="Los Angeles Opera">Los Angeles Opera</a> â€“ which debuted at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on September 6, 2008.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At age 19, Allen married 16-year-old Harlene Rosen. The marriage lasted from 1954 to 1959. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIME_(magazine)" title="TIME (magazine)">TIME</a></i> stated that the years were "nettling" and "unsettling."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rosen, whom Allen referred to in his standup act as â€œthe Dread Mrs. Allen,â€&#157; later <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit" title="Lawsuit">sued</a> Allen for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation" title="Defamation">defamation</a> due to comments at a TV appearance shortly after their divorce. Allen tells a different story on his mid-1960s standup album <i>Standup Comic.</i> In his act, Allen said that Rosen sued him because of a joke he made in an interview. Rosen had been <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape" title="Rape">sexually assaulted</a> outside her apartment and according to Allen, the newspapers reported that she â€œhad been violatedâ€&#157;.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Lasser" title="Louise Lasser">Louise Lasser</a> in 1966. They divorced in 1969 and Allen did not marry again until 1997. Lasser starred in three Allen films after the divorce â€“ <i>Take the Money and Run</i>, <i>Bananas</i>, and <i>Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)</i> â€“ and made a brief appearance in <i>Stardust Memories</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1970, Allen cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Keaton" title="Diane Keaton">Diane Keaton</a> in his Broadway play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_It_Again,_Sam" title="Play It Again, Sam">Play It Again, Sam</a></i>, which had a successful run. During it she became romantically involved and although Allen and Keaton broke up after a year, she continued to star in a number of his films, including <i>Sleeper</i> as a futuristic poet and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_and_Death" title="Love and Death">Love and Death</a></i> as a composite character based on the novels of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy" title="Leo Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky" title="Fyodor Dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a>. <i>Annie Hall</i> was very important in Allen and Keatonâ€™s careers. It is said that the role was written especially for her as Diane Keatonâ€™s given name is Diane Hall. She then starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interiors" title="Interiors">Interiors</a></i> as a poet, followed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i>.

Keaton has not worked with Allen since <i>Manhattan Murder Mystery.</i> Since the end of their romantic relationship, Keaton and Allen have remained close friends.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_(film)" title="Manhattan (film)">Manhattan</a></i> is said by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a> to be widely known to have been based on his romantic relationship with the actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stacey_Nelkin" title="Stacey Nelkin">Stacey Nelkin</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Around 1980, Allen began a 12-year relationship with actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mia_Farrow" title="Mia Farrow">Mia Farrow</a>, who had leading roles in several of his movies from 1982 to 1992. Farrow and Allen never married but they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adopt" title="Adopt">adopted</a> two children, Dylan Farrow (who changed her name to Eliza and is now known as Malone) and Moshe Farrow (now known as Moses); they also had one biological child, Satchel Farrow (now known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan_Seamus_Farrow" title="Ronan Seamus Farrow">Ronan Seamus Farrow</a>). Allen did not adopt any of Farrowâ€™s other family, including Soon-Yi Farrow Previn (the adopted daughter of Farrow and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Previn" title="AndrÃ© Previn">AndrÃ© Previn</a>, now known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soon-Yi_Previn" title="Soon-Yi Previn">Soon-Yi Previn</a>). Allen and Farrow separated in 1992 after Farrow discovered nude photographs that Allen had taken of Soon-Yi. In her autobiography, <i>What Falls Away</i> (New York: Doubleday, 1997), Farrow says that Allen admitted to a relationship with Soon-Yi.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Allen and Farrow separated, a long public legal battle for the custody of their three children began. During the proceedings, Farrow alleged that Allen had sexually molested their adopted daughter Dylan, who was then seven years old. The judge eventually concluded that the sex abuse charges were inconclusive but called Allenâ€™s conduct with Soon-Yi â€œgrossly inappropriateâ€&#157;. She called the report of the team that investigated the issue â€œsanitized and therefore, less credibleâ€&#157; and added that she had â€œreservations about the reliability of the reportâ€&#157;. Farrow won custody of their children. Allen was denied visitation rights with Malone and could see Ronan only under supervision. Moses, who was then 14, chose not to see Allen.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a 2005 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> interview, Allen estimated that, despite the scandalâ€™s damage to his reputation, Farrowâ€™s discovery of Allenâ€™s attraction to Soon-Yi Previn by finding nude photographs of her was â€œjust one of the fortuitous events, one of the great pieces of luck in my life. [...] It was a turning point for the better.â€&#157; Of his relationship with Farrow, he said, â€œIâ€™m sure there are things that I might have done differently. [...] Probably in retrospect I should have bowed out of that relationship much earlier than I did.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After ending his relationship with Farrow in 1992, Allen continued his relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soon-Yi_Previn" title="Soon-Yi Previn">Soon-Yi Previn</a>. Even though Allen never married or lived with Farrow and was never Previnâ€™s legal <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stepfather" title="Stepfather">stepfather</a>, the relationship between Allen and Previn has often been referred to as a father involved romantically with his stepdaughter since he had been perceived as being in Previnâ€™s life in a father-like capacity. For example, in 1991, <i>The New York Times</i> described Allenâ€™s family life by reporting, â€œFew married couples seem more married. They are constantly in touch with each other, and not many fathers spend as much time with their children as Allen does.â€&#157; Despite assertions from Previn that Allen was never a father figure to her, the relationship became a scandal. At the time, Allen was 56 and Previn was 22. Asked whether their age difference was conducive to â€œa healthy, equal relationship,â€&#157; Allen said equality is not necessarily a requirement in a relationship and said, â€œThe heart wants what it wants. Thereâ€™s no logic to those things. You meet someone and you fall in love and thatâ€™s that.â€&#157;</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen and Previn married on December 24, 1997, in the Palazzo Cavalli in Venice. The couple has adopted two daughters, naming them Bechet and Manzie after jazz musicians <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Bechet" title="Sidney Bechet">Sidney Bechet</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzie_Johnson" title="Manzie Johnson">Manzie Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Allen and Farrowâ€™s biological son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronan_Farrow" title="Ronan Farrow">Ronan Seamus Farrow</a>, said of Allen: "He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression. I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent...

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is set in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> and follows two main characters: Judah Rosenthal (Landau), a successful <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmologist" title="Ophthalmologist">ophthalmologist</a>, and Cliff Stern (Allen), a struggling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">filmmaker</a>. The two men are each confronted with moral crises.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Judah's crisis concerns his affair with a flight attendant Dolores Paley (Huston). After it becomes clear to her that Judah will not end his marriage, Dolores, scorned, attempts to inform his wife of their affair. Dolores' letter to his wife Miriam (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claire_Bloom" title="Claire Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>) is intercepted and destroyed by Judah, but she sustains the pressure on him with her threats of revelation. She is also aware of some questionable financial moves Judah has made.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Desperate, Judah turns to his brother, Jack (Orbach), who hires a hitman to kill Dolores. Later, before her corpse is discovered, Judah retrieves letters and other items from her apartment in order to cover his tracks. Stricken with guilt, Judah turns to the religious teachings he had rejected, believing for the first time that a just <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> is watching him and passing judgement.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time, Cliff is despondent over his failing marriage to his wife Wendy (Gleason), and he woos Halley, showing her footage from his ongoing documentary about Prof. Louis Levi, a renowned philosopher, a character based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo_Levi" title="Primo Levi">Primo Levi</a>. He tells Halley he's shooting Lester's documentary for the money so he can finish the documentary on Levi.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cliff's plain hatred of Lester are evident in a screening of the documentary film. It juxtaposes footage of Lester with shots of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini" title="Benito Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> addressing a throng of supporters from a balcony; it also depicts Lester yelling at his employees and clumsily making a pass at an attractive young actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Halley leaves for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, where Lester is offering her a producing job; when she returns several months later, Cliff learns that she and Lester are engaged. Hearing that Lester sent Halley a bouquet of white roses every week they were in London, Cliff is crestfallen as he realizes he is incapable of that kind of affectionate display. His last romantic gesture to Halley had been a love letter which, he admits, he had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism" title="Plagiarism">plagiarized</a> almost entirely from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Joyce" title="James Joyce">James Joyce</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Adding to Cliff's burdens, he learns that Prof. Levi, whom he had been profiling on the strength of his celebration of life, had committed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, leaving a curt note, "I've gone out the window."</p>
