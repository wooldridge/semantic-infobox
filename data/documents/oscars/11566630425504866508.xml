      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director Taylor Hackford kept Lou Gossett Jr. in separate living quarters from the other actors during <i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i> so he could intimidate them more during his scenes as a drill instructor.</p>

From Triumph's then-chairman, John Rosamond, in his book <i>Save The Triumph BonnevilleÂ !</i> (Veloce 2009), cinemas showing the film would be promoted at their local Triumph dealer and T140E Triumph Bonnevilles supplied by the dealer would be displayed in cinema foyers.</p>

Gere thought the ending wouldn't work because it was too sentimental. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Hackford" title="Taylor Hackford">Taylor Hackford</a> agreed with Gere until, during a rehearsal, the extras playing the workers began to cheer and cry. When Gere saw the scene later, with the music underneath it ("<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_Where_We_Belong" title="Up Where We Belong">Up Where We Belong</a>") at the right tempo, he said it gave him chills.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two versions of the film exist.

The main difference is that a majority of the foul language is edited out when the film airs on regular television. However, the group marching song near the beginning of the film and Mayo's solo marching song are not voiceover edits; they are reshoots of those scenes for television. Also, the sex scene between Mayo and Paula is cut in half, and the scene where Mayo finds Sid's body is also edited.</p>
