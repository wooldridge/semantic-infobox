	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>George Orson Welles</b> (May 6, 1915Â â€“ October 10, 1985), best known as <b>Orson Welles</b>, was an American filmmaker, actor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_director" title="Theatre director">theatre director</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenwriter" title="Screenwriter">screenwriter</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer" title="Film producer">producer</a>, who worked extensively in film, theatre, television and radio. Noted for his innovative dramatic productions as well as his distinctive voice and personality, Welles is widely acknowledged as one of the most accomplished dramatic artists of the twentieth century, especially for his significant and influential early workâ€”despite his notoriously contentious relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. His distinctive directorial style featured layered, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_narrative" title="Nonlinear narrative">nonlinear narrative</a> forms, innovative uses of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighting" title="Lighting">lighting</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiaroscuro" title="Chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>, unique camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus" title="Deep focus">deep focus</a> shots, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_take" title="Long take">long takes</a>. Welles's long career in film is noted for his struggle for artistic control in the face of pressure from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_studio" title="Movie studio">studios</a>, which resulted in many of his films being severely edited and others left unreleased. He has thus been praised as a major creative force and as "the ultimate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory" title="Auteur theory">auteur</a>."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles first found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">radio adaptation</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H.

It was reported to have caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an extraterrestrial invasion was occurring. Although these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to instant notoriety.</p>

Several of his other films, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_(film)" title="The Magnificent Ambersons (film)">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i> (1942), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Evil" title="Touch of Evil">Touch of Evil</a></i> (1958), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimes_at_Midnight" title="Chimes at Midnight">Chimes at Midnight</a></i> (1965), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F_for_Fake" title="F for Fake">F for Fake</a></i> (1974), are also widely considered to be masterpieces.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2002, he was voted the greatest film director of all time in two separate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute" title="British Film Institute">British Film Institute</a> polls among directors and critics, and a comprehensive survey of critical opinion, best-of lists, and critics' polls has determined that Welles is the most acclaimed director of all time. Well known for his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baritone" title="Baritone">baritone</a> voice, Welles was also an extremely well regarded actor and was voted number 16 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">AFI</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">100 Years... 100 Stars</a> list of the greatest American film actors of all time.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles was born May 6, 1915, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenosha,_Wisconsin" title="Kenosha, Wisconsin">Kenosha, Wisconsin</a> and was raised <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Roman Catholic Church">Roman Catholic</a>. Despite his parents' affluence, Welles encountered many hardships in childhood. In 1919, his parents separated and moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>. His father Richard, who had made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, Beatrice (nÃ©e Ives), a concert pianist, played during lectures by Dr. Dudley Crafts Watson at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Art_Institute" title="Chicago Art Institute">Chicago Art Institute</a> to support her son and herself. (The oldest Welles boy, "Dickie" had been institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties) Beatrice died of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice" title="Jaundice">jaundice</a> on May 10, 1924 in a Chicago hospital, four days after Welles's ninth birthday. After his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing his interest in music. He was taken in by Dr. Dudley Crafts Watson and lived with the family at Dr. Watson's family home, "Trillium Dell", on Marshman Avenue in Highland Park, Illinois. At the age of ten, Orson with Dr. Watson's third daughter, Marjorie (of the same age) ran away from home. They were found a week later, singing and dancing for money on a street corner in Milwaukee. His father died when Orson was fifteenâ€”during the summer after Orson's graduation from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_School_for_Boys" title="Todd School for Boys">Todd School for Boys</a>, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_school" title="Independent school">independent school</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_Illinois" title="Woodstock, Illinois">Woodstock, Illinois</a>â€”whereupon Maurice Bernstein a physician from Chicago, became his guardian.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who later became Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an <i>ad hoc</i> educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged his first theatrical experiments and productions there.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe with the aid of a small inheritance. Welles later reported that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_Theatre" title="Gate Theatre">Gate Theatre</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin" title="Dublin">Dublin</a> and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Edwards" title="Hilton Edwards">Hilton Edwards</a>, later said he didn't believe him but was impressed by his brashness and some impassioned quality in his audition. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate in 1931, appearing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jud_S%C3%BC%C3%9F_(play)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jud SÃ¼ÃŸ (play) (page does not exist)">Jew Suss</a></i> as the Duke. He acted to great acclaim, which reached the United States. He performed smaller supporting roles as well. On returning to the United States he found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i> and subsequently, <i>The Mercury Shakespeare</i>. Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the <i>Everybody's Shakespeare</i> series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An introduction by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thornton_Wilder" title="Thornton Wilder">Thornton Wilder</a> led Welles to the New York stage. In 1933, he toured in three off-Broadway productions with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a>'s company, including two roles in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Restless and impatient when the planned Broadway opening of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was canceled, Welles staged a drama festival of his own with the Todd School, inviting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miche%C3%A1l_MacL%C3%ADamm%C3%B3ir" title="MicheÃ¡l MacLÃ­ammÃ³ir">MicheÃ¡l MacLÃ­ammÃ³ir</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Edwards" title="Hilton Edwards">Hilton Edwards</a> from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear, along with New York stage luminaries. It was a roaring success. The subsequent revival of Cornell's <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> brought Welles to the notice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, who was casting for an unusual lead actor for the lead role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, working with many of the actors who would later form the core of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>. He married Chicago actress Virginia Nicholson in 1934 and that year he shot an eight-minute silent short film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hearts_of_Age" title="The Hearts of Age">The Hearts of Age</a></i> with her. The couple had one daughter, Christopher. She made her only film appearance in 1948, taking the role of Macduff's son in Welles's film <i>Macbeth</i> and later became known as Chris Welles Feder, an author of educational materials for children.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Renown_in_theater_and_radio_.281936.E2.80.931940.29">Renown in theater and radio (1936â€“1940)</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1936, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Theatre_Project" title="Federal Theatre Project">Federal Theatre Project</a> (part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration" title="Works Progress Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>) put unemployed theater performers and employees to work. Welles was hired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a> and assigned to direct a play for the Federal Theatre Project's Negro Theater Unit. He offered them <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i>, in a production that became known as the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voodoo_Macbeth" title="Voodoo Macbeth">Voodoo Macbeth</a></i>, because Welles set it in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haitian</a> court of King <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Christophe" title="Henri Christophe">Henri Christophe</a>, with voodoo witch doctors for the three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_Sisters" title="Weird Sisters">Weird Sisters</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Carter_(actor)" title="Jack Carter (actor)">Jack Carter</a> played Macbeth. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incidental_music" title="Incidental music">incidental music</a> was composed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Thomson" title="Virgil Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a>. The play was received rapturously and later toured the nation. When the lead actor, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maurice_Ellis&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maurice Ellis (page does not exist)">Maurice Ellis</a>, fell ill on tour, Welles quickly boarded an airplane to fly to the location and stepped into the part playing the role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackface" title="Blackface">blackface</a>. At the age of twenty, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. A few minutes of the Welles production of Macbeth was recorded on film in a 1937 documentary called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Work_Again" title="We Work Again">We Work Again</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The young actor/director was chosen by the American composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Copland" title="Aaron Copland">Aaron Copland</a> in 1937 to direct what is one of Copland's least known works, the opera <i>The Second Hurricane</i> composed for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school" title="High school">high school</a> students of The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Street_Settlement" title="Henry Street Settlement">Henry Street Settlement</a> Music School in New York. Among the few adult performers in the production was actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, Welles's longtime friend and collaborator, who was paid $10 for his performance.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the success of <i>Macbeth</i>, Welles mounted the absurd farce <i>Horse Eats Hat</i>. He consolidated his "White Hope" reputation with <i>Dr Faustus</i> which used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly blacked-out stage. In 1937, he rehearsed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Blitzstein" title="Marc Blitzstein">Marc Blitzstein</a>'s highly political operetta, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cradle_Will_Rock" title="The Cradle Will Rock">The Cradle Will Rock</a></i>. Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_Elliott_Theatre" title="Maxine Elliott Theatre">Maxine Elliott Theatre</a> was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any of the government-purchased materials being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Century_Theatre" title="New Century Theatre">the Venice</a>, about twenty blocks away. Some cast, as well as some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the federal theater project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, <i>The Cradle Will Rock</i> began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing their parts from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience. It afterward played at the Venice for two weeks in the same informal way.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Resigning from the Federal Theatre, Welles and Houseman formed the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">Mercury Theatre</a>, which eventually included actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_del_R%C3%ADo" title="Dolores del RÃ­o">Dolores del RÃ­o</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Collins_(actor)" title="Ray Collins (actor)">Ray Collins</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Coulouris" title="George Coulouris">George Coulouris</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Frank_Readick&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Frank Readick (page does not exist)">Frank Readick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eustace_Wyatt&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Eustace Wyatt (page does not exist)">Eustace Wyatt</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erskine_Sanford" title="Erskine Sanford">Erskine Sanford</a>, all of whom would continue to work for Welles for years. The first Mercury Theatre production was a melodramatic and heavily edited version of Shakespeare's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar_(play)" title="Julius Caesar (play)">Julius Caesar</a></i>, set in a contemporary frame of fascist Italy. Cinna the Poet dies at the hands not of a mob but of a secret police force. According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lloyd" title="Norman Lloyd">Norman Lloyd</a>, who played Cinna, "it stopped the show". The applause lasted more than ten minutes and the production was widely acclaimed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second year of the Mercury Theater, Welles shifted his interests to radio as an actor, director and producer. He played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Radio_Workshop" title="CBS Radio Workshop">The Columbia Workshop</a>, while adapting and directing the play. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Network" title="Mutual Network">Mutual Network</a> gave him a seven-week series to adapt <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Mis%C3%A9rables" title="Les MisÃ©rables">Les MisÃ©rables</a></i>, which he did with great success. In late 1937, Mutual chose Welles to play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamont_Cranston" title="Lamont Cranston">Lamont Cranston</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow" title="The Shadow">The Shadow</a></i> anonymously and in the summer of 1938 CBS gave him (and the Mercury Theatre) a weekly hour-long show to broadcast radio plays based on classic literary works. The show was titled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theatre" title="Mercury Theatre">The Mercury Theatre on the Air</a></i>, with original music by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>, who would continue working with Welles on radio and in films for years.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Their October 30, 1938 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">radio adaptation of <i>The War of the Worlds</i></a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells" title="H. G. Wells">H. G. Wells</a> brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners from the rival and far more popular <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Bergen" title="Edgar Bergen">Edgar Bergen/Charlie McCarthy program</a></i>, was later reported in the media to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction (although the extent of this confusion has recently come into question). Panic was reported to have spread (after citation from rumors) among many listeners who believed the news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> in a public speech a few months later.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's growing fame soon drew Hollywood offers, lures which the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. <i>The Mercury Theatre on the Air</i>, which had been a "sustaining show" (without sponsorship) was picked up by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Soup_Company" title="Campbell Soup Company">Campbell Soup</a> and renamed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campbell_Playhouse" title="The Campbell Playhouse">The Campbell Playhouse</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On October 28, 1940, Welles met H.G. Wells in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>; a local radio station <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTSA" title="KTSA">KTSA</a> recorded the conversation, which was likely the only meeting between the two.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Welles_in_Hollywood_.281939.E2.80.931948.29">Welles in Hollywood (1939â€“1948)</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Radio_Pictures" title="RKO Radio Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a> president <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaefer_(film_producer)" title="George Schaefer (film producer)">George Schaefer</a> eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract ever offered to an untried director: complete artistic control. RKO signed Welles in a two-picture deal; including script, cast, crew, and most importantly, final cut, although Welles had a budget limit for his projects. With this contract in hand, Welles (and nearly the entire Mercury Theatre troupe) moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. He commuted weekly to New York to maintain his commitment to <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles toyed with various ideas for his first project for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Radio_Pictures" title="RKO Radio Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a>, settling on an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Conrad" title="Joseph Conrad">Joseph Conrad</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness" title="Heart of Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i>, which he worked on in great detail. He planned to film the action with a subjective camera. When a budget was drawn up, RKO's enthusiasm cooled because it was greater than the previously agreed limit. RKO also declined to approve another Welles project, <i>The Smiler with the Knife</i>, ostensibly because they lacked faith in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucille_Ball" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille Ball</a>'s ability to carry the leading lady role.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a sign of things to come, Welles left <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i> in 1940 due to creative differences with the sponsor. The show continued without him, produced by John Houseman. In perhaps another sign of things to come, Welles's first experience on a Hollywood film was narrator for RKO's 1940 production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swiss_Family_Robinson" title="The Swiss Family Robinson">The Swiss Family Robinson</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RKO, having rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, agreed on the third offer <i>Citizen Kane,</i> in which Welles co-wrote, produced, directed, and performed the lead role.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles found a suitable film project in an idea he conceived with screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a>, (who was then writing radio plays for <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i>). Initially entitled, <i>American</i>, it eventually became Welles's first feature film (also his most famous and honored role), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i> (1941).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz based his original notion on an <i>exposÃ©</i> of the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a> whom he knew socially but now hated, having once been great friends with Hearst's mistress, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>. Mankiewicz had been banished from her company because of his perpetual drunkenness. Mankiewicz, a notorious gossip, exacted revenge with his unflattering depiction of Davies in <i>Citizen Kane</i> for which Welles bore most of the criticisms. Welles also had a connection with Davies through his first wife.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kane's megalomania was modeled loosely on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_R._McCormick" title="Robert R. McCormick">Robert McCormick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Pulitzer" title="Joseph Pulitzer">Joseph Pulitzer</a> as Welles wanted to create a broad, complex character, intending to show him in the same scenes from several points of view. The use of multiple narrative perspectives in Conrad's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness" title="Heart of Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i> influenced the treatment.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Supplying Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes, Welles urged him to write the first draft of a screenplay under John Houseman, who was posted to ensure Mankiewicz stayed sober. On Welles's instruction, Houseman wrote the opening narration as a pastiche of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_March_of_Time" title="The March of Time">The March of Time</a></i> newsreels. Orson Welles explained to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> about the writers working separately by saying, "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine." Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script but Welles countered the attacks by saying, "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all--who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charles Foster Kane is based loosely on parts of Hearst's life. Nonetheless, autobiographical allusions to Welles were worked in, most noticeably in the treatment of Kane's childhood and particularly, regarding his guardianship. Welles then added features from other famous American lives to create a general and mysterious personality rather than the narrow journalistic portrait intended by Mankiewicz, whose first drafts included scandalous claims about the death of the film director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Ince" title="Thomas H. Ince">Thomas Ince</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Once the script was completed, Welles attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Toland" title="Gregg Toland">Gregg Toland</a>, who walked into Welles's office and announced he wanted to work on the picture. Welles later described Toland as "the fastest cameraman who ever lived." For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. He invited suggestions from everyone but only if they were directed through him. Filming <i>Citizen Kane</i> took ten weeks.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz handed a copy of the final shooting script to his friend, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lederer" title="Charles Lederer">Charles Lederer</a>, husband of Welles's ex-wife, Virginia Nicholson as well as being the nephew of Hearst's mistress Marion Davies. Gossip columnist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> saw a small ad in a newspaper for a preview screening of <i>Citizen Kane</i> and went. Hopper, realizing immediately that the film was based on features of Hearst's life, reported this back to him and he threatened to give "Hollywood, Private Lives" if that was what it wanted. Thus began the struggle over the attempted suppression of <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hearst's media outlets boycotted the film. They exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community by threatening to expose fifteen years of suppressed scandals and the fact that most of the studio bosses were Jewish. At one point, the heads of the major studios jointly offered RKO the cost of the film in exchange for the negative and all existing prints, fully intending to burn them. RKO declined and the film was given a limited release. Hearst intimidated theater chains by threatening to ban advertising for any of their other films in any of his papers if they showed <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While the film was well-received critically, by the time it reached the general public the publicity had waned. It garnered nine Academy Award nominations (Orson nominated as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">producer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">director</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Writing_(Original_Screenplay)" title="Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)">writer</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">actor</a>), but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. Although it basically was ignored at the Academy Awards, <i>Citizen Kane</i> now is hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> called it "the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_a_Nation" title="The Birth of a Nation">The Birth of a Nation</a></i>."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The delay in its release and its uneven distribution contributed to its average result at the box office, making back its budget and marketing but RKO lost any chance of a major profit. The fact that <i>Citizen Kane</i> ignored many Hollywood conventions also meant that the film confused and angered the 1940s cinema public. Exhibitor response was scathing; most theater owners complained bitterly about the adverse audience reaction and the many walkouts. Only a few saw fit to acknowledge Welles's artistic technique. RKO shelved the film and did not re-release it until 1956.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1950s, the film came to be seen by young French film critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a> as exemplifying the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auteur_theory" title="Auteur theory">auteur theory</a>", in which the director is the "author" of a film. Truffaut, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Godard</a> and others inspired by Welles's example made their own films, giving birth to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nouvelle_Vague" title="Nouvelle Vague">Nouvelle Vague</a>. In the 1960s <i>Citizen Kane</i> became popular on college campuses as a film-study exercise and as an entertainment subject. Its frequent revivals on television, home video, and DVD have enhanced its "classic" status and ultimately it recouped its costs. The film still is considered by most film critics and historians to be one of the greatest motion pictures in cinema history.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's second film for RKO was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons_(film)" title="The Magnificent Ambersons (film)">The Magnificent Ambersons</a></i>, adapted from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Ambersons" title="The Magnificent Ambersons">novel</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booth_Tarkington" title="Booth Tarkington">Booth Tarkington</a>. George Schaefer hoped to make back the money lost by <i>Citizen Kane</i>. <i>Ambersons</i> already had been adapted for <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i> by Welles for the stage, and he then wrote the screen adaptation. Toland was not available, so <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cortez" title="Stanley Cortez">Stanley Cortez</a> was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez, however, was slow and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to production, Welles's contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At RKO's request, simultaneously, Welles worked on an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Ambler" title="Eric Ambler">Eric Ambler</a>'s spy thriller, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Fear_(1943_film)" title="Journey into Fear (1943 film)">Journey into Fear</a></i>, which he co-wrote with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was also producer. Direction was credited solely to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Foster_(director)" title="Norman Foster (director)">Norman Foster</a>. Welles later stated that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles then was offered a new radio series by CBS. Called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orson_Welles_Show" title="The Orson Welles Show">The Orson Welles Show</a></i>, it was a half-hour variety show of short stories, comedy skits, poetry, and musical numbers. Joining the original Mercury Theatre cast for the show, was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Edwards" title="Cliff Edwards">Cliff Edwards</a>, the voice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket" title="Jiminy Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a>, "on loan from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a>". The variety format was unpopular with listeners and Welles soon was forced to limit the content of the show simply to telling a one half-hour story for the entirety of each episode.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further complicate matters during the production of <i>Ambersons</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_into_Fear_(film)" title="Journey into Fear (film)">Journey into Fear</a></i>, Welles was approached by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jock_Whitney" title="Jock Whitney">Jock Whitney</a> to produce a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film" title="Documentary film">documentary film</a> about South America. This was at the behest of the federal government's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Neighbor_policy" title="Good Neighbor policy">Good Neighbor policy</a>, a wartime propaganda effort designed to prevent Latin America from allying with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers" title="Axis powers">Axis powers</a>. Welles saw his involvement as a form of national service, since his physical condition excused him from direct military service.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Expected to film the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" title="Brazilian Carnival">Carnaval</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, Brazil, Welles rushed to finish the editing on <i>Ambersons</i> and his acting scenes in <i>Journey into Fear</i>. Ending his CBS radio show, he lashed together a rough cut of <i>Ambersons</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wise" title="Robert Wise">Robert Wise</a>, who had edited <i>Citizen Kane</i>, and left for Brazil. Wise was to join him in Rio to complete the film, but never arrived. A provisional final cut arranged via phone call, telegram, and shortwave radio was previewed without Welles's approval in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomona" title="Pomona">Pomona</a> in a double bill, to a mostly negative audience response, particularly to the character of Aunt Fanny played by Agnes Moorehead. Whereas Schaefer argued that Welles be allowed to complete his own version of the film, and that an archival copy be kept with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum_of_Modern_Art" title="Museum of Modern Art">Museum of Modern Art</a> in New York City, RKO disagreed. With Welles in South America, there was no practical means of having him edit the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of the difficult financial circumstances that RKO found itself in across the period 1940-42, major changes occurred at the studio in 1942  <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd_Odlum" title="Floyd Odlum">Floyd Odlum</a> took over control of RKO and began changing its direction. Rockefeller, the most significant backer of the Brazil project, left the RKO board of directors. Around the same time, the principal sponsor of Welles at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. The changes throughout RKO caused reevaluations of many projects. RKO took control of <i>Ambersons</i>, formed a committee which was ordered to edit the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. They removed fifty minutes of Welles's footage, re-shot sequences, rearranged the scene order, and added a happy ending. Koerner released the shortened film on the bottom of a double-bill with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupe_V%C3%A9lez" title="Lupe VÃ©lez">Lupe VÃ©lez</a> comedy, <i>Mexican Spitfire Sees a Ghost</i>. <i>Ambersons</i> was an expensive flop for RKO, although it received four Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's South American documentary, entitled <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_All_True_(1942_film)" title="It's All True (1942 film)">It's All True</a></i>, budgeted at one million dollars with half of its budget coming from the U.S. Government upon completion, grew in ambition and budget while Welles was in South America. While the film originally was to be a documentary on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_Carnival" title="Brazilian Carnival">Carnaval</a>, Welles added a new story which recreated the journey of the <i>jangadeiros</i>, four poor fishermen who had made a 1,500-mile (2,400 km) journey on their open raft to petition Brazilian President Vargas about their working conditions. The four had become national folk heroes; Welles first read of their journey in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i>. Their leader, Jacare, died during a filming mishap. RKO, in limited contact with Welles, attempted to rein in the production. Most of the crew and budget were withdrawn from the film. In addition, the Mercury staff was removed from the studio in the U.S.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On returning to Hollywood, Welles found no studios interested in hiring him as a film director after the twin disasters of <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> and <i>It's All True</i>. Welles next worked on radio. CBS offered him two weekly series, <i>Hello Americans</i>, based on the research he'd done in Brazil, and <i>Ceiling Unlimited</i>, sponsored by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Corporation" title="Lockheed Corporation">Lockheed</a>, a wartime salute to advances in aviation. Both featured several members of his original Mercury Theatre troupe. Within a few months, <i>Hello Americans</i> was canceled and Welles was replaced as host of <i>Ceiling Unlimited</i> by Joseph Cotten. Welles guest-starred on a great variety of shows, notably guest-hosting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny" title="Jack Benny">Jack Benny</a> shows for a month in 1943. He took an increasingly active role in American and international politics and used journalism to communicate his forceful ideas widely.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1943, Welles married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" title="Rita Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a>. They had one child, Rebecca Welles, and divorced five years later in 1948. In between, Welles found work as an actor in other directors' films. He starred in the 1944 film adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre_(1944_film)" title="Jane Eyre (1944 film)">Jane Eyre</a></i>, trading credit as associate producer for top billing over <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a>. He also had a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_role" title="Cameo role">cameo</a> in the 1944 wartime salute <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Follow_the_Boys" title="Follow the Boys">Follow the Boys</a></i>, in which he performed his <i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> magic act and "sawed" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlene_Dietrich" title="Marlene Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a> in half after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> refused to allow Hayworth to perform.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1944, Welles was offered a new radio show, broadcast only in California, <i>Orson Welles' Almanac</i>. It was another half-hour variety show, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobil_Oil" title="Mobil Oil">Mobil Oil</a> as sponsor. After the success of his stand-in hosting on <i>The Jack Benny Show</i>, the focus was primarily on comedy. His hosting on the Jack Benny show included several self-deprecating jokes and story lines about his being a "genius" and overriding any ideas advanced by other cast members. The trade papers were not eager to accept Welles as a comedian, and Welles often complained on-air about the poor quality of the scripts. When Welles started his <i>Mercury Wonder Show</i> a few months later, traveling to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces" title="Armed Forces">Armed Forces</a> camps and performing magic tricks and doing comedy, the radio show was broadcast live from the camps and the material took on a decidedly wartime flavor. Of his original Mercury actors, only Agnes Moorehead remained working with him. The series was cancelled by year's end due to poor ratings.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While he found no studio willing to hire him as a film director, Welles's popularity as an actor continued. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pabst_Blue_Ribbon" title="Pabst Blue Ribbon">Pabst Blue Ribbon</a> gave Welles their radio series <i>This Is My Best</i> to direct, but after one month he was fired for creative differences. He started writing a political column for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i>, again called <i>Orson Welles's Almanac</i>. While the paper wanted Welles to write about Hollywood gossip, Welles explored serious political issues. His activism for world peace took considerable amounts of his time. The <i>Post</i> column eventually failed in syndication because of contradictory expectations and was dropped by the <i>Post</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1946, International Pictures released Welles's film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stranger_(1946_film)" title="The Stranger (1946 film)">The Stranger</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_G._Robinson" title="Edward G. Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young" title="Loretta Young">Loretta Young</a>, and Welles. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Spiegel" title="Sam Spiegel">Sam Spiegel</a> produced the film, which follows the hunt for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> war criminal living under an alias in America. While Anthony Veiller was credited with the screenplay, it had been rewritten by Welles and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>. Disputes occurred during the editing process between Spiegel and Welles. The film became a box office success and it helped his standing with the studios.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the summer of 1946, Welles directed a musical stage version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_in_Eighty_Days_(book)" title="Around the World in Eighty Days (book)">Around the World in Eighty Days</a></i>, with a comedic and ironic rewriting of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> novel by Welles, incidental music and songs by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</a>, and production by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Todd" title="Mike Todd">Mike Todd</a>, who would later produce the successful film version with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Niven" title="David Niven">David Niven</a>. When Todd pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, Welles alone supported the finances. When he ran out of money at one point, he convinced Columbia president <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> to send him enough to continue the show, and in exchange, Welles promised to write, produce, direct, and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed, due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes. The complicated financial arrangements concerning the show, its losses, and Welles's arrangement with Cohn, resulted in a tax dispute with the IRS.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the same time in 1946 he began two new radio series, <i>The Mercury Summer Theatre</i> for CBS and <i>Orson Welles Commentaries</i> for ABC. While <i>Summer Theatre</i> featured half-hour adaptations of some of the classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his <i>Around the World</i> stage play, and remains the only record of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Porter" title="Cole Porter">Cole Porter</a>'s music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. It only was scheduled for the summer months, and Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. <i>Commentaries</i> was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his New York Post column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAACP" title="NAACP">NAACP</a> brought to his attention the case of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Woodard" title="Isaac Woodard">Isaac Woodard</a>. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause. Soon Welles was being hanged in effigy in the South and theaters refused to show <i>The Stranger</i> in several southern states.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film Welles was obliged to make for Cohn helping him complete <i>Around the World in Eighty Days</i> ended up being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lady_from_Shanghai" title="The Lady from Shanghai">The Lady from Shanghai</a></i>, filmed in 1947 for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Intended to be a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star. Cohn disliked Welles's rough-cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brechtian" title="Brechtian">Brechtian</a> use of irony and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_comedy" title="Black comedy">black comedy</a>, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut had been removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly by the soundtrack, objecting to the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become one of the touchstones of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a>. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce. Although <i>The Lady From Shanghai</i> was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. for several decades. Influential modern critics including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kehr" title="David Kehr">David Kehr</a> have subsequently declared it a masterpiece, with Kehr calling it "the weirdest great movie ever made." A similar situation occurred when Welles suggested to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> that he star in a film directed by Welles based on the life of the French <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_killer" title="Serial killer">serial killer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9_Landru" title="Henri DÃ©sirÃ© Landru">Henri DÃ©sirÃ© Landru</a>. Instead, Chaplin adapted the idea for his own film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsieur_Verdoux" title="Monsieur Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a></i>, with Welles officially credited for the idea.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1948 Welles convinced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_Pictures" title="Republic Pictures">Republic Pictures</a> to let him direct a low-budget version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth_(1948_film)" title="Macbeth (1948 film)">Macbeth</a></i>, which featured extremely stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a prerecorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of the Shakespearean original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collage" title="Collage">collage</a> technique, and recasting <i>Macbeth</i> as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some of the voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are also visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-<i>Kane</i> Hollywood productions, <i>Macbeth</i> is closest to <i>Citizen Kane</i> in its use of long takes and deep focus photography. Shots of the increasingly isolated Scottish king looming in the foreground while other characters address him from deep in the background overtly reference <i>Kane</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Republic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents on the soundtrack and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, which included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Magazine" title="Life Magazine">Life Magazine</a>'s comment that Welles's film "doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.'" Welles left for Europe, while his co-producer and life-long supporter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Wilson_(producer)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Richard Wilson (producer) (page does not exist)">Richard Wilson</a> reworked the soundtrack. Welles ultimately returned and cut twenty minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover the gaps. The film was decried as another disaster. <i>Macbeth</i> had its share of influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau" title="Jean Cocteau">Jean Cocteau</a>, who hailed the film's "crude, irreverent power" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting "the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water." In the late 1970s, a fully restored version of <i>Macbeth</i> was released that followed Welles's original vision, and all prints of the truncated continuity have gradually been withdrawn from circulation, turning Welles compulsory recut, which has the distinction of being created by the director himself, into something of a lost work.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles left Hollywood for Europe in late 1947, enigmatically saying that he had chosen "freedom."

His co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akim_Tamiroff" title="Akim Tamiroff">Akim Tamiroff</a>, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's own productions during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, Welles starred as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Lime" title="Harry Lime">Harry Lime</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Reed" title="Carol Reed">Carol Reed</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Man" title="The Third Man">The Third Man</a></i>, alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>, his good friend and co-star from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>, with a script by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Greene" title="Graham Greene">Graham Greene</a> and a memorable <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zither" title="Zither">zither</a> score by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Karas" title="Anton Karas">Anton Karas</a>. The film was an international smash hit, but unfortunately Welles had turned down a percentage of the gross in exchange for a lump-sum advance. A few years later British radio producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Alan_Towers" title="Harry Alan Towers">Harry Alan Towers</a> would resurrect the Lime character for radio in the series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lives_of_Harry_Lime" title="The Lives of Harry Lime">The Lives of Harry Lime</a></i>. The 1951 series included new recordings by Karas, was very successful, and ran for 52 weeks. Welles claimed to write a handful of episodesâ€”a claim disputed by Towers, who maintains they were written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borneman" title="Ernest Borneman">Ernest Borneman</a>â€”which later would serve as the basis for the screenplay by Welles, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Arkadin" title="Mr. Arkadin">Mr. Arkadin</a></i> (1955).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also appeared as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesare_Borgia" title="Cesare Borgia">Cesare Borgia</a> in the 1949 Italian film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Foxes_(film)" title="Prince of Foxes (film)">Prince of Foxes</a></i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Power" title="Tyrone Power">Tyrone Power</a> and Mercury Theatre alumnus <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Sloane" title="Everett Sloane">Everett Sloane</a>, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Rose" title="The Black Rose">The Black Rose</a></i> (again with Tyrone Power).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello" title="Othello">Othello</a></i>. From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Othello_(1952_film)" title="Othello (1952 film)">Othello</a></i>, filming on location in Europe and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco" title="Morocco">Morocco</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left to find other acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammÃ³ir's published memoir <i>Put Money in Thy Purse</i>. When it premiered at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannes_Film_Festival" title="Cannes Film Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> it won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palme_d%27Or" title="Palme d'Or">Palme d'Or</a>, but was not given a general release in the United States until 1955 (by which time Welles had re-cut the first reel and re-dubbed most of the film, removing Cloutier's voice entirely), and it played only in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and Los Angeles. The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a complete drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. It was one of these flawed prints that was restored by Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Francesco_Lavagnino" title="Angelo Francesco Lavagnino">Angelo Francesco Lavagnino</a>'s original musical score (which was inaudible) and adding ambient stereo sound effects (which weren't in the original film). The subject of great controversy among film scholars, the restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America. A print of the U.S. version was released on laser-disc in 1995 and soon withdrawn after a legal challenge by Beatrice Welles-Smith. The original Cannes version has survived, but is not available commercially.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1952 Welles continued finding work in England, after the success of the <i>Harry Lime</i> radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Museum" title="The Black Museum">The Black Museum</a></i>, with Welles as host and narrator, and this would also run 52 weeks.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Late in 1953, Welles returned to America to star in a live CBS <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibus_(US_TV_series)" title="Omnibus (US TV series)">Omnibus</a></i> television presentation of Shakespeare's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear" title="King Lear">King Lear</a></i>.

While Welles received good notices, he was guarded by IRS agents, prohibited to leave his hotel room when not at the studio, prevented from making any purchases, and the entire sum (less expenses) he earned went to his tax bill. Welles returned to England after the broadcast.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Cases_of_Murder" title="Three Cases of Murder">Three Cases of Murder</a></i>, co-starring Badel. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Wilcox" title="Herbert Wilcox">Herbert Wilcox</a> cast him as the antagonist in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trouble_in_the_Glen" title="Trouble in the Glen">Trouble in the Glen</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Lockwood" title="Margaret Lockwood">Margaret Lockwood</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Tucker" title="Forrest Tucker">Forrest Tucker</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_McLaglen" title="Victor McLaglen">Victor McLaglen</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles's next turn as director was the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Arkadin" title="Mr. Arkadin">Mr. Arkadin</a></i> (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Arden" title="Robert Arden">Robert Arden</a>, who had worked on the Harry Lime series, Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was completely dubbed by actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Whitelaw" title="Billie Whitelaw">Billie Whitelaw</a>, and guest stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akim_Tamiroff" title="Akim Tamiroff">Akim Tamiroff</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Redgrave" title="Michael Redgrave">Michael Redgrave</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katina_Paxinou" title="Katina Paxinou">Katina Paxinou</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mischa_Auer" title="Mischa Auer">Mischa Auer</a>. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version which Dolivet completed was retitled <i>Confidential Report</i>. In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Filmmuseum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements. Released on DVD by the Criterion Company, it is considered by Welles scholar and director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> to be the best version of Welles's original intentions for the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1955 Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was <i>The Orson Welles Sketchbook</i>, a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of <i>It's All True</i> and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Around_the_World_with_Orson_Welles" title="Around the World with Orson Welles">Around the World with Orson Welles</a></i>, a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Venice, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_Country_(historical_territory)" title="Basque Country (historical territory)">Basque Country</a> between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore). A seventh episode of this series, based on the Gaston Dominici case, was suppressed at the time by the French government, but was reconstructed after Welles's death and released to video in 1999.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1956 Welles completed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Gina" title="Portrait of Gina">Portrait of Gina</a></i>, posthumously aired on German television under the title <i>Viva Italia</i>, a 30-minute personal essay on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Lollobrigida" title="Gina Lollobrigida">Gina Lollobrigida</a> and the general subject of Italian sex symbols. Dissatisfied with the resultsâ€”Welles recalled he had worked on it a lot and the result looked like itâ€”he left the only print behind at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B4tel_Ritz_Paris" title="HÃ´tel Ritz Paris">Ritz Hotel</a> in Paris.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a> in the 1958 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_of_Evil" title="Touch of Evil">Touch of Evil</a></i>, based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whit_Masterson" title="Whit Masterson">Whit Masterson</a>'s novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badge_of_Evil" title="Badge of Evil">Badge of Evil</a></i> (Welles, who wrote the screenplay for the film, claimed never to have read the book).

After the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections. The studio followed a few of the ideas, but cut another 30 minutes from the film and released it. The film was widely praised across Europe, awarded the top prize at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_%2758" title="Expo '58">Brussels World's Fair</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1978, the long preview version of the film was rediscovered and released.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By this time he had ceased filming <i>Quixote</i>. Though he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1970s, he never completed the film. As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jes%C3%BAs_Franco" title="JesÃºs Franco">JesÃºs Franco</a> constructed a film out of the portions of <i>Quixote</i> left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961 Welles directed <i>In the Land of Don Quixote</i>, a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAI" title="RAI">RAI</a>. Similar to the <i>Around the World with Orson Welles</i> series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1962 Welles directed his adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_(1962_film)" title="The Trial (1962 film)">The Trial</a></i>, based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial" title="The Trial">the novel</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka" title="Franz Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> and produced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Salkind" title="Alexander Salkind">Alexander Salkind</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_Salkind&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Michael Salkind (page does not exist)">Michael Salkind</a>.

Welles thought the location possessed a "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> modernism" and a melancholy sense of "waiting", both suitable for Kafka. The film failed at the box-office. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny.

According to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Moreau" title="Jeanne Moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a>, Welles delayed filming for two weeks due to stage fright.

The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again.

The first of these was an adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isak_Dinesen" title="Isak Dinesen">Isak Dinesen</a>'s <i>The Heroine</i>, meant to be a companion piece to <i>The Immortal Story</i> and starring Kodar.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Dreamers_(unfinished_film_by_Orson_Welles)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Dreamers (unfinished film by Orson Welles) (page does not exist)">The Dreamers</a></i>, based on two stories by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isak_Dinesen" title="Isak Dinesen">Isak Dinesen</a> and starring Oja Kodar, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Orson_Welles_Magic_Show&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="The Orson Welles Magic Show (page does not exist)">The Orson Welles Magic Show</a></i>, which reused material from his failed TV pilot.

Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the <i>Magnum, P.I.</i> producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enchanted_Journey" title="The Enchanted Journey">The Enchanted Journey</a></i> (1984) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie" title="The Transformers: The Movie">The Transformers: The Movie</a></i> (1986), in which he played the planet-eating <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot" title="Robot">robot</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicron" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>.

They lived a torrid romance between 1938 and 1942, though he was ten years her junior. They collaborated together in the movie <i>Journey into Fear</i> but the affair ended soon afterward.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1934, Welles eloped with Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson.

The couple had been estranged during the making of <i>The Lady from Shanghai</i>. After five years, Rita filed for divorce, her reason to the press being, "I can't take his genius any more." During his last interview and only two hours before his death, Welles answered Merv Griffin's lustful comment "But one of your wives--Oh, I have envied you so many years for Rita Hayworth", by calling her "one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived" and saying that he was "lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1955 Welles married Italian actress Paola Mori (Countess Paola Di Girifalco). Estranged for decades, the couple were never divorced. Croatian-born actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oja_Kodar" title="Oja Kodar">Oja Kodar</a> became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 on. They lived together for the last twenty-four years of his life. A year after Orson's death, Paola and Oja finally agreed on the settling of his will. On the way to their meeting to sign the papers, however, Paola was killed in a car accident.</p>

His eyes were brown. Other sources cite that he was 6Â feet 4Â inches (193 cm) tall, but the slates from costume tests made during the 1940s show him as 6Â feet 1Â inch (185 cm).

Welles replied, "I try to be a Christian, I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God." After the success of his 1941 film <i>Citizen Kane</i>, Welles announced that his next film would be about the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" title="Jesus Christ">Jesus Christ</a>, and that he would play the lead role.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of Welles's claimed familial ties have not held up under scrutiny.

Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles, son of his paternal grandfather Richard Jones Welles; Gideon Welles had no son by that name. His sons were Hubert (1833â€“1862), John Arthur (1845â€“1883), Thomas G. (1846â€“1892), and Edgar Thaddeus Welles (1843â€“1914).</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles was politically active from the beginning of his career.

Filming stopped with the death of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Reiguera" title="Francisco Reiguera">Francisco Reiguera</a>, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1970 Welles began shooting <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Other_Side_of_the_Wind" title="The Other Side of the Wind">The Other Side of the Wind</a></i>, about the effort of a film director (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Huston" title="John Huston">John Huston</a>) to complete his last Hollywood picture, and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972, the filming was reported by Welles as being "96% complete", but Welles had only edited 40% of the film by 1979. In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault where it remained until 2004, when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> (who also acted in the film) announced his intention to complete the production.

Allegedly, Welles approached <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> to ask for assistance in rescuing the film, but Spielberg declined. The scripts to both films were published posthumously. After a studio auction, he complained that Spielberg spent $50,000 for the Rosebud sled used in <i>Citizen Kane</i>, but would not give him a dime to make a picture. Welles retaliated by publicly announcing the sled to be a fake, the original having been burned in the film, but later recanted the claim.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jaglom" title="Henry Jaglom">Henry Jaglom</a> said of this period: "These same stars and whiz kid directors wouldn't help him get one of his movies made. Any one of these people could have made Orson's life so much happier these past 10 years just by nodding their heads." The same theme was repeated by another Welles friend, singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eartha_Kitt" title="Eartha Kitt">Eartha Kitt</a> after Welles's death: "The way Hollywood treated him was a form of envy, jealousy.

According to this play, Welles privately disliked Olivier's film adaptations of Shakespeare's works (which were far more successful than Welles's), at one point stating that Olivier's film of <i>Hamlet</i> "looked like a Joan Crawford movie".

Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's end credits read "Most of the principal actors are new to motion pictures. The Mercury Theatre is proud to introduce them." Welles along with his partner <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a> had assembled them into a group known as the Mercury Players to perform his productions in the Mercury Theatre in 1937. After accepting his Hollywood contract in 1939, Welles worked between Los Angeles and New York where the Mercury Theatre continued their weekly radio broadcasts for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Campbell_Playhouse" title="The Campbell Playhouse">The Campbell Playhouse</a></i>. Welles had wanted all the Mercury Players to debut in his first film, but the cancellation of <i>The Heart of Darkness</i> project in December 1939 created a financial crisis for the group and some of the actors worked elsewhere. This caused friction between Welles and Houseman, and their partnership ended.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RKO executives were dismayed that so many of the major roles went to unknowns, but Welles's contract left them with no say in the matter.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Orson Welles' notoriety following <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a></i> broadcast earned him <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>'s interest, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO" title="RKO">RKO</a> studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaefer_(film_producer)" title="George Schaefer (film producer)">George J. Schaefer's</a> unusual contract. Welles made a deal with Schaefer on July 21, 1939 to produce, direct, write, and act in two feature films. The studio had to approve the story and the budget if it exceeded $500,000. Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, cast his own actors and crew members, and have the privilege of final cutÂ â€“ unheard of at the time for a first-time director. He had spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get several projects going with no success. The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Reporter" title="Hollywood Reporter">Hollywood Reporter</a></i> said, "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there." First, Welles tried to adapt <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_of_Darkness" title="Heart of Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a></i>, but there was concern over the idea to depict it entirely with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_view_shot" title="Point of view shot">point of view shots</a>. Welles considered adapting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_Day-Lewis" title="Cecil Day-Lewis">Cecil Day-Lewis</a>' novel <i>The Smiler With The Knife</i>, but realized that to challenge himself with a new medium, he had to write an original story.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz was recuperating from a car accident and in-between jobs. He had originally been hired by Welles to work on <i>The Campbell Playhouse</i> radio program and was available to work on the screenplay for Welles' film. The writer had only received two screenplay credits between 1935 and his work on <i>Citizen Kane</i> and needed the job. There is dispute amongst historians regarding whose idea it was to use William Randolph Hearst as the basis for Charles Foster Kane. Welles claimed it was his idea while film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> (in her essay "Raising Kane") and Welles' former business partner <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a> claim that it was Mankiewicz's idea. For some time, Mankiewicz had wanted to write a screenplay about a public figureÂ â€“ perhaps a gangsterÂ â€“ whose story would be told by the people that knew him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz had already written an unperformed play entitled, <i>The Tree Will Grow</i> about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dillinger" title="John Dillinger">John Dillinger</a>. Welles liked the idea of multiple viewpoints but was not interested in playing Dillinger. Mankiewicz and Welles talked about picking someone else to use a model. They hit on the idea of using Hearst as their central character. Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. The writer resented this and became obsessed with Hearst and Marion Davies. Hearst had great influence and the power to retaliate within Hollywood so Welles had Mankiewicz work on the script outside of the city. Because of the writer's drinking problem, Houseman went along to provide assistance and make sure that he stayed focused. Welles also sought inspiration from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Insull" title="Samuel Insull">Samuel Insull</a> (who built an opera house for his girlfriend). Although Mankiewicz and Houseman got on well with Welles, they incorporated some of his traits into Kane, such as his temper.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During production, <i>Citizen Kane</i> was referred to as <i>RKO 281</i>. Most of the filming took place between June 29, 1940 and October 23, 1940 in what is now Stage 19 on the Paramount lot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>. There was some location filming with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balboa_Park" title="Balboa Park">Balboa Park</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo" title="San Diego Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oheka_Castle" title="Oheka Castle">Oheka Castle</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington,_New_York" title="Huntington, New York">Huntington, New York</a> representing Kane's San Simeon estate. Welles prevented studio executives of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Pictures" title="RKO Pictures">RKO</a> from visiting the set. He understood their desire to control projects and he knew they were expecting him to do an exciting film that would correspond to his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds_(radio)" title="The War of the Worlds (radio)">The War of the Worlds</a></i> radio broadcast. Welles' RKO contract had given him complete control over the production of the film when he signed on with the studio, something that he never again was allowed to exercise when making motion pictures. According to an RKO cost sheet from May 1942, the film cost $839,727 compared to an estimated budget of $723,800.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles ran a closed set, limited access to rushes and managed the publicity of <i>Kane</i> to make sure that its influence from Hearst's life was a secret. Publicity materials stated the film's inspiration was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust" title="Faust">Faust</a></i>. RKO hoped to release the film in mid-February 1941. Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941. <i>Friday</i> magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>, Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers, and made a fool of her in public. Reportedly, she was furious and demanded an immediate preview of the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>, who was present at the screening, said that she walked out of the film. Soon after, Parsons called George Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released <i>Kane</i>. The next day, the front page headline in <i>Daily Variety</i> read, "HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS." In two weeks, the ban was lifted for everything except <i>Kane."</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios in order to force RKO to shelve <i>Kane</i>. Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by Nicholas Scheck, head of MGM's parent company, with an offer on the behalf of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> and other Hollywood executives to reimburse RKO if it would destroy the film. Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that <i>Kane</i> would be released as scheduled and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers. There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst. Welles agreed and Wise was brought in to cut the film's running time from two hours, two minutes and 40 seconds to one hour, 59 minutes and 16 seconds. This cut of <i>Kane</i> satisfied the corporate lawyers.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Screenplay">Screenplay</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Richard Carringer, author of <i>The Making of Citizen Kane</i> (1996), described the early stages of the screenplay:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, according to film author Harlan Lebo, he was also "one of Hollywood's most notorious personalities." Mankiewicz was the older brother of producer-director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Mankiewicz" title="Joseph Mankiewicz">Joseph Mankiewicz</a> and was a former writer for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker" title="The New Yorker">The New Yorker</a></i> and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> and had moved to Hollywood in 1926. By the time Welles contacted him he had "established himself as a brilliant wit, a writer of extraordinary talent, [and] a warm friend to many of the screen world's brightest artistsÂ ... [he] produced dialogue of the highest caliber." Yet Mankiewicz's behavior, according to Welles's close friend and associate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, was also a "public and private scandal. A neurotic and homophobic drinker and compulsive gambler..." Houseman adds, however, that he was also one of the most intelligent, informed, witty, humane and charming men I have ever known." Despite those apparent contradictions in his personality, Welles "recognized the writer's abilities and trusted him to produce", wrote Lebo. Orson Welles himself later commented, "Nobody was more miserable, more bitter, and funnier than Mankâ€”a perfect monument to self-destruction. But when the bitterness wasn't focused straight at you â€“ he was the best company in the world."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to film historian Clinton Heylin, "the idea of <i>Citizen Kane</i> was the original conception of Orson Welles, who in early 1940 first discussed the idea with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, who then suggested that both he and Welles leave for Los Angeles and discuss the idea with scriptwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Mankiewicz" title="Herman Mankiewicz">Herman Mankiewicz</a>. He adds that Mankiewicz "probably believed that Welles had little experience as an original scriptwriter...[and] may even have felt that <i>John Citizen USA</i>, Welles's working title, was a project he could make his own." Orson Welles said that his preparation before making Citizen Kane was to watch <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecoach_(1939_film)" title="Stagecoach (1939 film)">Stagecoach</a></i> forty times.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Still incapacitated with a broken leg, Mankiewicz was happy to work with Welles, and an "alliance" formed, noted Houseman. This combination of a "brash new director, a nervous studio, and an erratic genius" gave birth to <i>Citizen Kane</i>, in what Houseman called, "an absurd venture."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles then assigned Mankiewicz, writes Lebo, "to work on an original screenplayâ€”not an adaptation as his first two projects would have been." Welles next traveled to New York and desperately "pleaded and persuaded Houseman to return to Los Angeles to manage Mankiewicz and his writing schedule."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to film critic and author Pauline Kael, Mankiewicz "was already caught up in the idea of a movie about Hearst" when he was still working at the <i>New York Times</i>, in 1925. She learned from his family's babysitter, Marion Fisher, that she once typed as "he dictated a screenplay, organized in flashbacks. She recalls that he had barely started on the dictation, which went on for several weeks, when she remarked that it seemed to be about William Randolph Hearst, and he said, 'You're a smart girl.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Hollywood, Mankiewicz had frequented Hearst's parties until his alcoholism got him barred. And Hearst was also a person known to Welles. "Once that was decided", wrote author Don Kilbourne, "Mankiewicz, Welles, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a>, a cofounder of the Mercury Theatre, rented a place in the desert, and the task of creating <i>Citizen Kane</i> began." This "place in the desert" was on the historic Verde ranch on the Mojave River in Victorville. In later years, Houseman gave Mankiewicz "total" credit for "the creation of <i>Citizen Kane's</i> script" and credited Welles with "the visual presentation of the picture."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mankiewicz was put under contract by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_Theater" title="Mercury Theater">Mercury Productions</a> and was to receive no credit for his work as he was hired as a script doctor. According to his contract with RKO, Welles would be given sole screenplay credit, and had already written a rough script consisting of 300 pages of dialogue with occasional stage directions under the title of <i>John Citizen, USA</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the long standing debates of <i>Citizen Kane</i> has been the proper accreditation of the authorship of the screenplay, which the credits attribute to both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J. Mankiewicz">Herman J. Mankiewicz</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a>. Mankiewicz biographer Richard Meryman notes that the dispute had various causes, including the way the movie was promoted. For instance, when RKO opened the movie on Broadway on May 1, 1941, followed by showings at theaters in other large cities, the publicity programs that were printed included photographs of Welles as "the one-man band, directing, acting, and writing." In a letter to his father afterward, Mankiewicz wrote, "I'm particularly furious at the incredibly insolent description of how Orson wrote his masterpiece. The fact is that there isn't one single line in the picture that wasn't in writing â€“ writing from and by me â€“ before ever a camera turned." Film historian Otto Friedrich said it made Mankiewicz "unhappy to hear Welles quoted in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>'s column, before the question of screen credits was officially settled, as saying, 'So I wrote <i>Citizen Kane</i>.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a>, Rita Alexander, who was hired to be Mankiewicz's personal secretary, stated that she "took the dictation from Mankiewicz from the first paragraph to the lastÂ ... and later did the final rewriting and the cuts, and handled the script at the studio until after the film was shot. ...[and said] Welles didn't write (or dictate) one line of the shooting script of <i>Citizen Kane.</i> She added that "Welles himself came to dinner once or twice...[and] she didn't meet him until after Mankiewicz had finished dictating the long first draft." However Welles had his own secretary, Katherine Trosper, who typed up Welles' suggestions and corrections, which were incorporated into the final script; Kael did not interview Trosper before producing her article.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, Mankiewicz went to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Writers_Guild" title="Screen Writers Guild">Screen Writers Guild</a> and declared that he was the original author. Welles later claimed that he planned on a joint credit all along, but Mankiewicz claimed that Welles offered him a bonus of ten thousand dollars if he would let Welles take full credit." According to Pauline Kael, "he had ample proof of his authorship, and when he took his evidence to the Screen Writers GuildÂ ... Welles was forced to split the credit and take second place in the listing."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kael argues that Mankiewicz was the true author of the screenplay and therefore responsible for much of what made the movie great. This angered many critics of the day, most notably critic-turned-filmmaker (and close friend of Welles) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, who rebutted many of Kael's claims in an article for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)" title="Esquire (magazine)">Esquire</a></i> titled <i>The Kane Mutiny</i>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_L._Carringer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert L. Carringer (page does not exist)">Robert L.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the time the movie was released, however, Mankiewicz's contribution to the film was generally known, according to Kael. The <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Reporter" title="Hollywood Reporter">Hollywood Reporter</a></i> wrote the credit as "Written by Herman Mankiewicz;" Burns Mantle, in his newspaper column, referred to Mankiewicz having written it; and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Hecht" title="Ben Hecht">Ben Hecht</a> wrote, "This movie was not written by Orson Welles. It is the work of Herman J. Mankiewicz." Kael noted in 1971 that "Under the present rules of the Guild, Welles's name would probably not have appeared." She also came to an ironic conclusion:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson_(film_critic)" title="David Thomson (film critic)">David Thomson</a>, however, "No one can now deny Herman Mankiewicz credit for the germ, shape, and pointed language of the screenplay, but no one who has seen the film as often as it deserves to be seen would dream that Welles is not its only begetter." Carringer considered that at least three scenes were solely Welles' work and, after weighing both sides of the argument, including sworn testimony from Mercury assistant Richard Baer, concluded, "We will probably never know for sure, but in any case Welles had at last found a subject with the right combination of monumentality, timeliness, and audacity." Harlan Lebo agrees, and adds, "of far greater relevance is reaffirming the importance of the efforts that both men contributed to the creation of Hollywood's greatest motion picture."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles never confirmed who the principal source was for the character of Charles Foster Kane. It is believed that he is a synthesis of different personalities although main inspiration was the life of media tycoon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Randolph_Hearst" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>. The film is seen by critics as a fictionalized, unrelentingly hostile <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</a> of Hearst. According to film historian Don Kilbourne, "much of the information for <i>Citizen Kane</i> came from already-published material about Hearst... [and] some of Kane's speeches are almost verbatim copies of Hearst's. When Welles denied that the film was about the still-influential publisher, he did not convince many people."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles himself insisted that there were also differences between the men. In 1968, he told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a>, "You know, the real story of Hearst is quite different from Kane's. And Hearst himself â€” as a man, I mean â€” was very different." Hearst's biographer, David Nasaw, finds the film's depiction of Hearst unfair:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Citizen Kane</i> is in part based on the life of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Insull" title="Samuel Insull">Samuel Insull</a> and his wife Gladys. Playwright Herman J. Mankiewicz based Susan Alexander's catastrophic operatic debut in <i>Citizen Kane</i> on Gladys Wallis Insull's New York role as Lady Teazle in a charity revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_for_Scandal" title="The School for Scandal">The School for Scandal</a></i>. Jed Leland's review of Susan Alexander's debut in <i>Kane</i> echoes Mankiewicz's actual 1925 review of Gladys Insull. His 1925 review began: "As Lady Teazle, Mrs. Insull is as pretty as she is diminutive; with a clear smile and dainty gestures. There is a charming grace in her bearing that makes for excellent deportment. But Lady Teazle seems much too innocent to lend credit to her part in the play."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are autobiographical elements to the film. Orson Welles lost his mother when he was nine years old and his father when he was 15. After this, he became the ward of Chicago's Dr. Maurice Bernstein; Bernstein is the last name of the only major character in <i>Citizen Kane</i> who receives a generally positive portrayal.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Movie tycoon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Brulatour" title="Jules Brulatour">Jules Brulatour</a>'s second and third wives, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Gibson" title="Dorothy Gibson">Dorothy Gibson</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hope_Hampton" title="Hope Hampton">Hope Hampton</a>, both fleeting stars of the silent screen who later had marginal careers in opera, are believed to have provided inspiration for the Susan Alexander character.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also claimed that business tycoon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Fowler_McCormick" title="Harold Fowler McCormick">Harold Fowler McCormick</a>'s lavish promotion of his second wife, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganna_Walska" title="Ganna Walska">Ganna Walska</a>, was a direct influence on the screenplay. McCormick spent thousands of dollars on voice lessons for her and even arranged for Walska to take the lead in a production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaza_(play)" title="Zaza (play)">Zaza</a></i> at the Chicago Opera in 1920. Like the Susan Alexander character, she had a terrible voice, pleasing only to McCormick. But unlike Alexander, Walska got into an argument with director Pietro Cimini during dress rehearsal and stormed out of the production before she appeared. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>, in his DVD commentary on <i>Citizen Kane</i>, also suggests that the Alexander character was based on Walska, and had very little to do with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>. The film's composer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a>, also suggested that Kane is based on McCormick but also in great part on Welles himself.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The character of political boss Jim Gettys is based on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Murphy" title="Charles F. Murphy">Charles F. Murphy</a>, a political leader in New York City's infamous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall" title="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</a> political machine, who was an enemy of Hearst. In one scene Gettys admonishes Kane for printing a cartoon showing him in prison stripes. This is based on the fact that Murphy, who was a horse-cart driver and owned several bars, was depicted in a 1903 Hearst cartoon wearing striped prison clothes. A caption, referring to the restaurant Murphy frequented, said: "Look out, Murphy. It's a short lock-step from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delmonico%27s_Restaurant" title="Delmonico's Restaurant">Delmonico's</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sing_Sing" title="Sing Sing">Sing Sing</a>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Welles author David Thomson, "Rosebud is the greatest secret in cinema..."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Orson Welles, explaining the idea behind the word "Rosebud", said, "It's a gimmick, really, a rather tawdry device, a dollar-book <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_psychology" title="Freudian psychology">Freudian</a> gag." Three "Rosebud" sleds were used in production, of which only one was not burned.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Louis Pizzitola, author of <i>Hearst Over Hollywood</i>, "Rosebud" was a nickname that Orrin Peck, a friend of William Randolph Hearst, gave to his mother, Phoebe Hearst. It was said that Phoebe was as close, or even closer, to Orrin than she was to her own son, lending a bitter-sweet element to the word's use in a film about a boy being separated from his mother's love.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1989, essayist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gore_Vidal" title="Gore Vidal">Gore Vidal</a> cited contemporary rumors that "Rosebud" was a nickname Hearst used for his mistress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>; a reference to her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clitoris" title="Clitoris">clitoris</a>, a claim repeated as fact in the 1996 documentary <i>The Battle Over Citizen Kane</i> and again in the 1999 dramatic film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_281" title="RKO 281">RKO 281</a></i>. Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> has been a bit more specific than Vidal about the source, saying on his commentary track for the September 2001 DVD release that "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_J._Mankiewicz" title="Herman J.

A resultant joke noted, with heavy innuendo, that Hearst and/or Kane died "with 'Rosebud' on his lips."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Filmmaking_innovations">Filmmaking innovations</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film scholars and historians view <i>Citizen Kane</i> as Welles' attempt to create a new style of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filmmaking" title="Filmmaking">filmmaking</a> by studying various forms of movie making, and combining them all into one. The most innovative technical aspect of <i>Citizen Kane</i> is the extended use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus" title="Deep focus">deep focus</a>. In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. This was done by cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Toland" title="Gregg Toland">Gregg Toland</a> through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Specifically, Toland often used telephoto lenses to shoot close-up scenes. Any time deep focus was impossibleÂ â€” for example in the scene when Kane finishes a bad review of Alexander's opera while at the same time firing the person who started the reviewÂ â€” an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_printer" title="Optical printer">optical printer</a> was used to make the whole screen appear in focus (visually layering one piece of film onto another). However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-camera_effect" title="In-camera effect">in-camera effects</a>, as in the famous example of the scene where Kane breaks into Susan Alexander's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-angle_shot" title="Low-angle shot">low-angle shots</a> were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Since movies were primarily filmed on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage" title="Sound stage">sound stages</a> and not on location during the era of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">studio system</a>, it was impossible to film at an angle that showed ceilings because the stages had none. In some instances, Welles' crew used <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslin" title="Muslin">muslin</a> draped above the set to produce the illusion of a regular room with a ceiling, while the boom microphones were hidden above the cloth and even dug a trench into the floor to allow the low-angle shot to be used in the scene where Kane meets Leland after his election loss.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Toland had approached Welles in 1940 to work on <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Welles' reputation for experimentation in the theatre appealed to Toland and he found a sympathetic partner to "test and prove several ideas generally being accepted as radical in Hollywood".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Citizen Kane</i> eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreliable_narrator" title="Unreliable narrator">unreliable narrator</a> in literature. Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood movies. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist" title="Communist">communist</a> and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist" title="Fascist">fascist</a>. The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuthering_Heights_(1939_film)" title="Wuthering Heights (1939 film)">Wuthering Heights</a></i> in 1939 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_and_the_Glory_(film)" title="The Power and the Glory (film)">The Power and the Glory</a></i> in 1933 but no film was so immersed in this technique as <i>Citizen Kane</i>. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the narrative voices is the <i>News on the March</i> segment. Its stilted dialogue and portentous voiceover is a parody of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_March_of_Time" title="The March of Time">The March of Time</a></i> newsreel series which itself references an earlier newsreel which showed the 85-year old arms czar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Basil_Zaharoff" title="Sir Basil Zaharoff">Sir Basil Zaharoff</a> getting wheeled to his train. Welles had earlier provided voiceovers for <i>the March of Time</i> radio show. <i>Citizen Kane</i> makes extensive use of stock footage to create the newsreel.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the story-telling techniques used in <i>Citizen Kane</i> was the use of montage to collapse time and space. Using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in 5 vignettes, which takes 16 years of story time and condenses it into two minutes of screen time.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also pioneered several visual effects in order to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene where the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for the second Mrs. Kane's performance was shot by a camera <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panning_(camera)" title="Panning (camera)">panning</a> upwards over the performance scene, then a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipe_(transition)" title="Wipe (transition)">curtain wipe</a> to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xanadu_(Citizen_Kane)" title="Xanadu (Citizen Kane)">Xanadu</a>. A loud, full-screen closeup of a typewriter typing a single word ("weak"), magnifies the review for the <i>Chicago Inquirer</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The non-union make up artist Maurice Seiderman created the make-up for the film. RKO wanted the young Kane to look handsome and dashing, and Seiderman transformed the already-overweight Welles, beginning with his nose, which Welles always disliked. Welles was as made up as a young man as he was an old man, and could barely move. For the old Kane, Seiberman created a red plastic compound which he applied to Welles, allowing the wrinkles to move naturally. Kane's mustache was made of several hair tufts. Transforming Welles into the old Kane required six to seven hours, meaning he had to start at two in the morning to begin filming at nine, meaning he held conferences in the make-up chair, and would also work a total of 16 hours a day. Even breaking a leg during filming could not stop him from directing around-the-clock, and he quickly returned to acting, using a steel leg bracer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to expanding on the potential of sound as a creator of moods and emotions, Welles pioneered a new aural technique, known as the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_editing" title="Film editing">montage</a> sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. In offering a continuous sound track, Welles was able to join what would otherwise be extremely rough cuts together into a smooth narrative. For example, the audience witnesses Kane grow from a child into a young man in just two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_(film)" title="Shot (film)">shots</a>. As Kane's guardian hands him his sled, Kane begrudgingly wishes him a "Merry Christmas". Suddenly we are taken to a shot of his guardian fifteen years later, only to have the phrase completed for us: "and a Happy New Year". In this case, the continuity of the soundtrack, not the image, is what makes for a seamless narrative structure.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Welles also carried over techniques from radio not yet popular in the movies (though they would become staples). Using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, the result gave the impression of a whole town talkingÂ â€” and, equally important, what the town was talking about. Welles also favored the overlapping of dialogue, considering it more realistic than the stage and movie tradition of characters not stepping on each other's sentences. He also pioneered the technique of putting the audio ahead of the visual in scene transitions (a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=J-cut&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="J-cut (page does not exist)">J-cut</a>); as a scene would come to a close, the audio would transition to the next scene before the visuals did.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In common with using personnel he had previously worked with in the Mercury Theatre, Welles recruited his close friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Herrmann" title="Bernard Herrmann">Bernard Herrmann</a> to score Citizen Kane. Herrmann was a longtime collaborator with Welles, providing music for almost all his radio broadcasts including <i>The Fall of the City</i> (1937) and the <i>War of the Worlds</i> (1938) broadcast. The film was Herrmann's first motion picture score and would be nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score" title="Academy Award for Best Original Score">Academy Award for Best Original Score</a>, but would lose out to his own score for the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_and_Daniel_Webster_(1941_film)" title="The Devil and Daniel Webster (1941 film)">All That Money Can Buy</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herrmann's score for Citizen Kane was a watershed in film soundtrack composition and proved as influential as any of the film's other innovations, establishing him as an important voice in film soundtrack composition. The score eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues which typically lasted between five and fifteen seconds to bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotiv" title="Leitmotiv">leitmotiv</a> played by low <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodwind" title="Woodwind">woodwinds</a>, including a quartet of bass <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flutes" title="Flutes">flutes</a>. Much of the music used in the newsreel was taken from other sources; examples include the <i>News on the March</i> music which was taken from RKO's music library, <i>Belgian March</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Vincent_Collins" title="Anthony Vincent Collins">Anthony Collins</a>, and accompanies the newsreel titles; and an excerpt from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Newman" title="Alfred Newman">Alfred Newman</a>'s score for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunga_Din_(film)" title="Gunga Din (film)">Gunga Din</a></i> which is used as the background for the exploration of Xanadu. In the final sequence of the film, which shows the destruction of Rosebud in the fireplace of Kane's castle, Welles choreographed the scene while he had Herrmann's cue playing on the set.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the operatic sequence which exposed Kane's protege Susan Alexander for the amateur she was, Herrmann composed a quasi-romantic scene, <i>Aria from SalammbÃ´</i>. There did exist two treatments of this work by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustave_Flaubert" title="Gustave Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a>'s 1862 novel, including an opera by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Reyer" title="Ernest Reyer">Ernest Reyer</a> and an incomplete treatment by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modeste_Mussorgsky" title="Modeste Mussorgsky">Modeste Mussorgsky</a>. However, Herrmann made no reference to existing music. Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander. Herrmann said he wanted to convey the impression of "a terrified girl floundering in the quicksand of a powerful orchestra". On the soundtrack it was soprano <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_Forward&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jean Forward (page does not exist)">Jean Forward</a> who actually sang the vocal part for actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Comingore" title="Dorothy Comingore">Dorothy Comingore</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972 Herrmann said "I was fortunate to start my career with a film like <i>Citizen Kane</i>, it's been a downhill run ever since!" Shortly before his death in 1985, Welles told director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jaglom" title="Henry Jaglom">Henry Jaglom</a> that that the score was fifty per cent responsible for the film's artistic success.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Opera lovers are frequently amused by the parody of vocal coaching that appears in a singing lesson given to Susan Alexander by Signor Matiste. The character attempts to sing the famous cavatina "Una voce poco fa" from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_barbiere_di_Siviglia" title="Il barbiere di Siviglia">Il barbiere di Siviglia</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gioachino_Rossini" title="Gioachino Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>, but the lesson is interrupted when Alexander sings a high note flat.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An uncredited <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nat_King_Cole" title="Nat King Cole">Nat King Cole</a> is believed to provide the music in two key scenes in the film. He can be heard playing piano, but not singing, "This Can't Be Love" (actually sung by Alton Redd), in the scene where Susan fights with Kane. Welles heard him playing at a bar and created the scene around the song. Unconfirmed reports suggest he can also be heard playing in the scene where Thompson questions a down-at-heel Susan in the nightclub she works; however, Bernard Herrmann denied any knowledge of this to musicologist David Meeker.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Citizen Kane</i> was supposed to open at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_City_Music_Hall" title="Radio City Music Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> but did not because Parsons told <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller" title="Nelson Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> that if the film was screened, Hearst's <i>American Weekly</i> magazine would run a negative article about his grandfather. Other exhibitors feared retaliation and refused to handle the film. Schaefer lined up a few theaters but Welles grew impatient and threatened RKO with a lawsuit. Hearst papers refused to accept advertising for the film. <i>Kane</i> opened at the RKO Palace on Broadway in New York on May 1, 1941, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> on May 6, and in Los Angeles on May 8. <i>Kane</i> did well in cities and larger towns but fared poorly in more remote areas. RKO still had problems getting exhibitors to show the film. For example, one chain controlling more than 500 theaters got Welles' film as part of a package but refused to play it, reportedly out of fear of Hearst. The film lost $150,000 during its initial run.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The reviews for the film were overwhelmingly positive, although some reviewers were challenged by Welles' break with Hollywood traditions. Kate Cameron, in her review for the <i>New York Daily-News</i>, said that <i>Kane</i> was "one of the most interesting and technically superior films that has ever come out of a Hollywood studio".

Borges noted that "Overwhelmingly, endlessly, Orson Welles shows fragments of the life of the man, Charles Foster Kane, and invites us to combine them and reconstruct him." As well, "Forms of multiplicity and incongruity abound in the film: the first scenes record the treasures amassed by Kane; in one of the last, a poor woman, luxuriant and suffering, plays with an enormous jigsaw puzzle on the floor of a palace that is also a museum." Borges points out, "At the end we realize that the fragments are not governed by a secret unity: the detested Charles Foster Kane is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacrum" title="Simulacrum">simulacrum</a>, a chaos of appearances."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wise" title="Robert Wise">Robert Wise</a> recalled each time <i>Citizen Kane</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s name was called out as a nominee, the crowd booed. Most of Hollywood did not want the film to see the light of day, considering the threats that William Randolph Hearst had made if it did. According to <i>Variety</i>, block voting against Welles by screen extras denied him Best Picture and Actor awards. British film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Norman" title="Barry Norman">Barry Norman</a> attributed this to Hearst's wrath.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In December 2007, Welles' Oscar for best original screenplay came up for auction at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby%27s" title="Sotheby's">Sotheby's</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, but failed to reach its estimate of $800,000 to $1.2 million.

At the same sale, Welles' personal copy of the last revised draft of <i>Citizen Kane</i> before the shooting script, did sell for $97,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Board_of_Review" title="National Board of Review">National Board of Review</a> gave 1941 "Best Acting" awards to Orson Welles and George Coulouris, and the film itself "Best Picture." That same year, the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> named it one of the Ten Best Films of the year, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Award" title="New York Film Critics Circle Award">New York Film Critics Circle Award</a> for "Best Picture" also went to <i>Citizen Kane</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hearing about the film enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slander" title="Slander">slander</a> Welles. Following lobbying from Hearst, the head of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B_Mayer" title="Louis B Mayer">Louis B Mayer</a>, acting on behalf of the whole film industry, made an offer to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative. Welles used Hearst's opposition to <i>Citizen Kane</i> as a pretext for previewing the movie in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Schaefer_(film_producer)" title="George Schaefer (film producer)">George Schaefer</a> of RKO rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conglomerate" title="Conglomerate">conglomerate</a> from reviewingÂ â€” or even mentioningÂ â€” the movie. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire. The documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Over_Citizen_Kane" title="The Battle Over Citizen Kane">The Battle Over Citizen Kane</a></i> lays the blame for <i>Citizen Kane</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. Even though it did decent business at the box office and went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, this fell short of its creators' expectations, but was still acceptable to its backers. In <i>The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst</i>, David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason <i>Kane</i> failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a pair of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arena_(TV_series)" title="Arena (TV series)">Arena</a></i> documentaries about Welles' career produced and broadcast domestically by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> in 1982, Welles claimed that during opening week, a policeman approached him one night and told him: "Do not go to your hotel room tonight; Hearst has set up an undressed, underage girl to leap into your arms when you enter and a photographer to take pictures of you. Hearst is planning to publish it in all of his papers." Welles thanked the man and stayed out all night. However, it is not confirmed whether this was true. Welles also described how he accidentally bumped into Hearst in an elevator at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairmont_Hotel" title="Fairmont Hotel">Fairmont Hotel</a> when <i>Kane</i> was opening in San Francisco. Welles' father had been friends with Hearst, so Welles tried to comfortably ask if Hearst would see the film. Hearst ignored him. "As he was getting off at his floor, I said 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled the director. "And Kane would have you know. That was his style."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Hearst's efforts to suppress it damaged the film's success, they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect" title="Streisand effect">backfired in the long run</a>, since almost every reference to Hearst's life and career made today typically includes a reference to the film's parallel to it. The irony of Hearst's efforts is that the film is now inexorably connected to him. This connection was reinforced by the publication in 1961 of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W.A._Swanberg" title="W.A. Swanberg">W. A. Swanberg's</a> extensive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biography" title="Biography">biography</a>, <i>Citizen Hearst</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1942 <i>Citizen Kane</i> had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished from America until 1956. In that period, <i>Kane'</i>s and Welles' reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Griffith" title="Richard Griffith">Richard Griffith</a> in his overview of cinema, <i>The Film Till Now</i>, dismissed <i>Kane</i> as "tinpot if not crackpot <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud" title="Sigmund Freud">Freud</a>."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, <i>Citizen Kane</i> was little seen in Europe. It was not until 1946 that it was shown in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, where it gained considerable acclaim, particularly from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_critics" title="Film critics">film critics</a> such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Bazin" title="AndrÃ© Bazin">AndrÃ© Bazin</a> and from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahiers_du_cinema" title="Cahiers du cinema">Cahiers du cinema</a></i> writers, including future film directors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>. In his 1950 essay "The Evolution of Cinema", Bazin placed <i>Citizen Kane</i> centre stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States. RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television and early that year <i>Citizen Kane</i> started to appear on television. Around the same time the film was rereleased theatrically to coincide with Welles return to the New York stage where he played <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Lear" title="King Lear">King Lear</a>.</i> That year American film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> wrote "Citizen Kane: The American Baroque" for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Culture" title="Film Culture">Film Culture</a></i> and described it as "the great American film," further enhancing the film's status. During the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_58" title="Expo 58">Expo 58</a>, a poll of over 100 film historians named <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battleship_Potemkin" title="The Battleship Potemkin">The Battleship Potemkin</a></i> the greatest film ever made, while <i>Kane</i> was part of the top ten. When a group of young film directors cast their vote for their top six, they were booed at the announcement for not including the film. In the decades since, its critical status as one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Films_that_have_been_considered_the_greatest_ever" title="Films that have been considered the greatest ever">the greatest films ever made</a> has grown with numerous essays and books on it including influential books like Peter Cowie's <i>The Cinema of Orson Welles</i>, Ronald Gottesman's <i>Focus on Citizen Kane</i>, a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, "Raising <i>Kane</i>", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before. Despite its criticism of Welles it further popularized the notion of <i>Citizen Kane</i> as <i>the</i> great American film. The rise of art house and film society circuits also aided in the film's rediscovery.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The British magazine <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sight_%26_Sound" title="Sight &amp; Sound">Sight &amp; Sound</a></i> has produced a Top Ten list surveying film critics every decade since 1952 and is regarded as one of the most respected barometers of critical taste. <i>Citizen Kane</i> was a runner up to the top 10 in its 1952 poll but was voted as the greatest film ever made in its 1962 poll and it has retained the top spot in every subsequent poll.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has also ranked number one in the following film "best of" lists: Editorial Jaguar, FIAF Centenary List, France Critics Top 10, Cahiers du cinÃ©ma 100 films pour une cinÃ©mathÃ¨que idÃ©ale, Kinovedcheskie Russia Top 10, Romanian Critics Top 10, Time Out Magazine Greatest Films, and Village Voice 100 Greatest Films. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called <i>Citizen Kane</i> the greatest movie ever made.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite its status as a revered classic, <i>Citizen Kane</i> is not entirely without its critics. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_University" title="Boston University">Boston University</a> film scholar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Carney" title="Ray Carney">Ray Carney</a>, although noting its technical achievements, criticized what he saw as the film's lack of emotional depth, shallow characterization and empty metaphors. Listing it among the most overrated works within the film community, he accused the film of being "an all-American triumph of style over substance." The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden" title="Sweden">Swedish</a> director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> once stated his dislike for the movie, calling it "a total bore" and claiming that the "performances are worthless." He went on to call Orson Welles an "infinitely overrated filmmaker."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similarly, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agate" title="James Agate">James Agate</a> wrote, "I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull...Mr. Welles's high-brow direction is of that super-clever order which prevents you from seeing what that which is being directed is all about."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original camera negative of <i>Citizen Kane</i> was destroyed in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> film laboratory fire in the 1970s. Subsequent prints were ultimately derived from a nitrate fine grain positive made in the 1940s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern techniques were used to produce a pristine print for a 50th Anniversary theatrical revival reissue in 1991 (released by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>). The 2003 British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> edition is taken from an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpositive" title="Interpositive">interpositive</a> held by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Film_Institute" title="British Film Institute">British Film Institute</a>. The current US DVD version (released by Warner Home Video) is taken from another digital restoration, supervised by Turner's company. The transfer to Region 1 DVD has been criticized by some film experts for being too bright. Also, in the scene in Bernstein's office (chapter 10), rain falling outside the window has been digitally erased, probably because it was thought to be excessive film grain. These alterations are not present in the UK Region 2, which is also considered to be more accurate in terms of contrast and brightness.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003, Orson Welles' daughter Beatrice sued <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turner_Entertainment" title="Turner Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> and RKO Pictures, claiming that the Welles estate is the legal <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> holder of the film. Her attorney said that Orson Welles had left RKO with an exit deal terminating his contracts with the studio, meaning that Welles still had an interest in the film and his previous contract giving the studio the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright</a> of the film was null and void. Beatrice Welles also claimed that, if the courts did not uphold her claim of copyright, RKO nevertheless owed the estate 20% of the profits, from a previous contract which has not been lived up to.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On May 30, 2007, the appeals panel agreed that Beatrice Welles could proceed with the lawsuit against Turner Entertainment; the opinion partially overturns the 2004 decision by a lower court judge who had found in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1980s, this film became the catalyst in the controversy over the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_colorization" title="Film colorization">colorization</a> of black and white films. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Turner" title="Ted Turner">Ted Turner</a> told members of the press that he was considering colorizing <i>Citizen Kane</i>, his comments led to an immediate public outcry. About two weeks before his death, and almost a year before Turner acquired the rights to the MGM catalog, Welles had asked filmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Jaglom" title="Henry Jaglom">Henry Jaglom</a>, "Please do this for me. Don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons." The uproar was for nothing, as Turner could not have colorized the film had he wanted to. Welles' original contract prevented any alteration to the film without his, and eventually his estate's, express consent. Turner later claimed that this was a joke intended to needle colorization critics, and that he had never had any intention of colorizing the film.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Legacy">Legacy</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite the critical success of <i>Citizen Kane</i> it nevertheless marked a decline in Welles' fortune. In the book <i>Whatever Happened to Orson Welles?</i>, Joseph McBride argues that the problems in making <i>Citizen Kane</i> caused lasting damage to his career.

Hollywood's treatment of Welles and his work ultimately led to his self imposed exile in Europe for much of the rest of his career where he found a more sympathetic audience.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_Over_Citizen_Kane" title="The Battle Over Citizen Kane">The Battle Over Citizen Kane</a></i> points out the great irony that Welles's own life story resembled that of Kane far more than Hearst's: an overreaching <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wunderkind" title="Wunderkind">wunderkind</a></i> who ended up mournful and lonely in his old age. <i>Citizen Kane'</i>s editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wise" title="Robert Wise">Robert Wise</a> summarized: "Well, I thought often afterwards, only in recent years when I saw the film again two or three years ago when they had the fiftieth anniversary, and I suddenly thought to myself, well, Orson was doing an autobiographical film and didn't realize it, because it's rather much the same, you know. You start here, and you have a big rise and tremendous prominence and fame and success and whatnot, and then tail off and tail off and tail off. And at least the arc of the two lives were very much the same..."</p>

Kane, he said, "had none of the qualities of an artist, Orson had all the qualities of an artist." Bogdanovich also noted that Welles was never bitter "about all the bad things that happened to him", and was a man who enjoyed life in his final years.
