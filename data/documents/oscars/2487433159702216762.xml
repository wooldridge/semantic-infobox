Born shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the experience had some lasting impact on him. In response to an interview question when an interviewer remarked that he seemed quite calm in the aftermath of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_September_attacks" title="11 September attacks">11 September attacks</a>, he said: "Well, darling, you forgetÂ â€” I slept under a steel plate until I was four years old."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">McKellen's father, Denis Murray McKellen, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_engineer" title="Civil engineer">civil engineer</a>, was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laity" title="Laity">lay</a> preacher, and both of his grandfathers were preachers. At the time of Ian's birth, his parents already had a five-year-old daughter, Jean. His home environment was strongly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a>, but non-orthodox. "My upbringing was of low nonconformist Christians who felt that you led the Christian life in part by behaving in a Christian manner to everybody you met." When he was 12, his mother, Margery Lois (<i>nÃ©e</i> Sutcliffe) died; his father died when he was 24. When he <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out_of_the_closet" title="Coming out of the closet">came out of the closet</a> to his stepmother, Gladys McKellen, who was a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_Society_of_Friends" title="Religious Society of Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a>: "Not only was she not fazed, but as a member of a society which declared its indifference to people's sexuality years back, I think she was just glad for my sake that I wasn't lying anymore."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">McKellen attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_School" title="Bolton School">Bolton School</a> (boys division), of which he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton_Little_Theatre" title="Bolton Little Theatre">Bolton Little Theatre</a>, of which he is now the patron. An early fascination with the theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a></i> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Opera_House" title="Manchester Opera House">Manchester Opera House</a> when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and bakelite, fold-away Victorian Theatre from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollock%27s_Toy_Museum" title="Pollock's Toy Museum">Pollocks Toy Theatres</a>, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Olivier's Hamlet. His sister took him to his first Shakespeare play, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night,_or_What_You_Will" title="Twelfth Night, or What You Will">Twelfth Night</a></i>, by the amateurs of Wigan's Little Theatre, shortly followed by their <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i> and Wigan High School for Girls' production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream" title="A Midsummer Night's Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></i> with music by Mendelssohn and with the role of Bottom played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jean_McKellen&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Jean McKellen (page does not exist)">Jean McKellen</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He won a scholarship to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Catharine%27s_College,_Cambridge" title="St Catharine's College, Cambridge">St Catharine's College, Cambridge</a>, when he was eighteen, where he developed an attraction to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Jacobi" title="Derek Jacobi">Derek Jacobi</a>. He has characterised it as "a passion that was undeclared and unrequited". He and his first serious partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolton" title="Bolton">Bolton</a>, began their relationship in 1964. It lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-story Victorian conversion in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_Street" title="Narrow Street">Narrow Street</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limehouse" title="Limehouse">Limehouse</a>.

According to Mathias, the ten-year love affair was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias' somewhat less-successful career.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early 1980s, McKellen lost his appetite for meat except for fish, and so mostly precludes it from his diet.</p>

The context that prompted McKellen's decisionÂ â€” overriding concerns about a possible negative effect on his careerÂ â€” was that the controversial Section 28 of the Local Government Bill, simply known as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28" title="Section 28">Section 28</a>" was under consideration in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Parliament of the United Kingdom">British Parliament</a>.

He has said of this period: "My own participating in that campaign was a focus for people [to] take comfort that if Ian McKellen was on board for this, perhaps it would be all right for other people to be as well, gay and straight". Section 28 was, however, enacted and remained on the statute books until 2003.

However, due to Sauron's "life force" being bound to the Ring, the Dark Lord is not completely defeated unless the Ring itself is destroyed, but Isildur, corrupted by the Ring's power, refuses to do so. Sometime later, Isildur is ambushed and killed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orcs</a> and the Ring is lost in a river.

Gandalf is then forced to watch as Saruman, following Sauron's orders, commands the Orcs of Isengard to construct weapons of war and produce a new breed of Orc fighters called the Uruk-hai.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While travelling to Bree, Frodo and Sam are soon joined by fellow Hobbits, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a>.

Arwen also uses her magic to cut off the pursuing Ringwraiths at the Ford of Bruinen, summoning a surge of water that sweeps the Ringwraiths away.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In Rivendell, Frodo finds Gandalf, who explains why he didn't meet them at Bree and that he had escaped Orthanc and Saruman's clutches with the help of an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagle</a>. Later, Elrond calls a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Elrond" title="Council of Elrond">council</a> to decide what should be done with the Ring.

The Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava" title="Lava">fires</a> of Mount Doom, where it was forged.

Frodo manages to escape by putting the Ring on his finger and vanishing. Aragorn encounters Frodo, but unlike Boromir, Aragorn chooses not to take the Ring. Knowing that the Ring's temptation will be too strong for the Fellowship, Frodo decides to leave them and go to Mordor alone. Meanwhile, the rest of the Fellowship are attacked by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruk-hai" title="Uruk-hai">Uruk-hai</a>, who Saruman had ordered to hunt down the Fellowship and take back the Ring.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jackson, Walsh and Boyens made numerous changes to the story, for purposes of pacing and character development. Jackson said his main desire was to make a film focused primarily on Frodo and the Ring, the "backbone" of the story. The prologue condenses Tolkien's backstory, in which The Last Alliance's seven year siege of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barad-d%C3%BBr" title="Barad-dÃ»r">Barad-dÃ»r</a> is a single battle, where Sauron is shown to explode, though Tolkien only said his spirit flees.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Events at the beginning of the film are condensed or omitted altogether. In the book the time between Gandalf leaving the Ring to Frodo and returning to reveal its inscription, which is 17 years, is compressed for timing reasons. Frodo also spends a few months preparing for his journey to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bree_(Middle-earth)" title="Bree (Middle-earth)">Bree</a> which is compressed to a day, to increase dramatic tension. Also compressed is the time between Frodo and Sam leaving Bag End and their meeting Merry and Pippin. Characters such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Bombadil" title="Tom Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a> are left out to simplify the plot and increase the threat of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="NazgÃ»l">Ringwraiths</a>. Such sequences are left out to make time to introduce Saruman, who in the book only appears in flashback until <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Towers" title="The Two Towers">The Two Towers</a></i>. Saruman's role is enhanced: he is to blame for the blizzard on Caradhras, a role taken from Sauron and/or Caradhras itself in the book. Gandalf's capture by Saruman is also expanded with a fight sequence.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barliman_Butterbur" title="Barliman Butterbur">Barliman Butterbur</a> at the Prancing Pony is largely removed for time and dramatic flow.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The events at Weathertop were also altered. The location of the fight against the Ringwraiths was changed to the ruins on top of the hill rather than a campsite at its base. When Frodo was stabbed in the book, the party spent two weeks travelling to Rivendell, but in the movie this is shortened to less than a week, with Frodo's condition worsening at a commensurately greater rate. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a> was given a greater role in the movie; she accompanied Frodo all the way to Rivendell, while in the book Frodo faced the Ringwraiths alone at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_of_Bruinen" title="Ford of Bruinen">Ford of Bruinen</a>. The character of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glorfindel" title="Glorfindel">Glorfindel</a> was omitted entirely and his scenes were also given to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a>. She was tacitly credited with the river rising against the Ringwraiths, which was the work of her father <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> with aid from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> in the book.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A significant new addition is Aragorn's self-doubt, which causes him to hesitate to claim the kingship of Gondor. This element is not present in the book, where Aragorn intends to claim the throne at an appropriate time. In the book <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narsil" title="Narsil">Narsil</a> is reforged immediately when he joins the Fellowship, but this event is held over until <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King">The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</a></i> in film to symbolically coincide with his acceptance of his title. These elements were added because Peter Jackson believed that each character should be forced to grow or change over the course of the story.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a>'s character gained an adversarial edge; he expresses doubts in the strength of Men to resist Sauron's evil after Isildur's failure to destroy the ring as depicted in the prologue. Jackson also shortens the Council of Elrond by spreading its exposition into earlier parts of the film. Elrond's counsellor, Erestorâ€”who suggested the Ring be given to Tom Bombadilâ€”was completely absent from this scene. Gimli's father, GlÃ³in, was also deemed unnecessary.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The tone of the Moria sequence was altered. Although in the book the Fellowship only realises the Dwarves are all dead once they reach <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balin_(Middle-earth)" title="Balin (Middle-earth)">Balin</a>'s tomb, the filmmakers chose to use <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreshadowing" title="Foreshadowing">foreshadowing</a> devices instead. Gandalf says to Gimli he would prefer not to enter Moria, and Saruman is shown to be aware of Gandalf's reticence, and also reveals an illustration of the Balrog in one of his books. The corpses of the dwarves are instantly shown as the Fellowship enter Moria.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jackson began working with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Rivers" title="Christian Rivers">Christian Rivers</a> to storyboard the trilogy in August 1997, as well as getting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Taylor_(movies)" title="Richard Taylor (movies)">Richard Taylor</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weta_Workshop" title="Weta Workshop">Weta Workshop</a> to begin creating his interpretation of Middle-earth. Jackson told them to make Middle-earth as plausible and believable as possible, to think of Middle-earth in a historical manner.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In November, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lee" title="Alan Lee">Alan Lee</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howe" title="John Howe">John Howe</a> became the primary conceptual designers for the film trilogy, having had previous experience as illustrators for the book and various other tie-ins. Lee worked for the Art Department creating places such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell" title="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="LothlÃ³rien">LothlÃ³rien</a>, giving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_nouveau" title="Art nouveau">art nouveau</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry" title="Geometry">geometry</a> influences to the Elves and Dwarves respectively. Though Howe contributed with Bag End and the Argonath, he focused working on armour having studied it all his life. Weta and the Art Department continued to design, with Grant Major turning the Art Department's designs into architecture, and Dan Hennah scouting locations. On 1 April 1999, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ngila_Dickson" title="Ngila Dickson">Ngila Dickson</a> joined the crew as costume designer. She and 40 seamstresses would create 19,000 costumes, 40 per version for the actor and their doubles, ageing and wearing them out for impression of age.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> makes extensive use of digital, practical and make-up <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_effects" title="Special effects">special effects</a> throughout. One noticeable illusion that appears in almost every scene involves setting a proper scale so that the characters are all the correct height. Elijah Wood, who plays Frodo, is 5Â ft 6in (1.68 m) tall in real life, but the character of Frodo Baggins is barely four feet in height. Many different tricks were used to depict the hobbits (and Gimli the Dwarf) as being of diminutive stature. (As a matter of good fortune, John-Rhys DaviesÂ â€” who played GimliÂ â€” is as tall compared to the hobbit actors as his character needed to be compared to theirs, so he did not need to be filmed separately as a third variation of height.) Large and small scale doubles were used in certain scenes, while entire duplicates of certain sets (including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_End" title="Bag End">Bag End</a> in Hobbiton) were built at two different scales, so that the characters would appear to be the appropriate size. At one point in the film, Frodo runs along a corridor in Bag End, followed by Gandalf. Elijah Wood and Ian McKellen were filmed in separate versions of the same corridor, built at two different scales, and a fast camera pan conceals the edit between the two. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_perspective" title="Forced perspective">Forced perspective</a> was also employed, so that it would look as though the short hobbits were interacting with taller Men and Elves. Even the simple use of kneeling down, to the film makers' surprise, turned out to be an effective method in creating the illusion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the battle between the Last Alliance and the forces of Sauron that begins the film, an elaborate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">CGI</a> animation system, called <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASSIVE_(software)" title="MASSIVE (software)">MASSIVE</a>, was developed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Regelous" title="Stephen Regelous">Stephen Regelous</a>; it allowed thousands of individual animated "characters" in the program to act independently. This helped give the illusion of realism to the battle sequences. The "Making of" Lord of the Rings DVD reports some interesting initial problems: in the first execution of a battle between groups of characters, the wrong groups attacked each other. In another early demo, some of the warriors at the edge of the field could be seen running away. The reason was not that they were programmed for cowardice (or survival) and could not see the enemy so they ran away, but that they were initially moving in the wrong direction, and had been programmed to keep running until they encountered an enemy.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The digital creatures were important due to Jackson's requirement of biological plausibility. Their surface was scanned from large <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maquette" title="Maquette">maquettes</a> before numerous digital details of their skeletons and muscles were added. In the case of the Balrog, Gary Horsfield created a system that copied recorded imagery of fire.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The musical score for the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> films was composed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Shore" title="Howard Shore">Howard Shore</a>. It was performed by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, The London Philharmonic Orchestra, The London Voices, and featured several vocal soloists. Two original songs, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An%C3%ADron" title="AnÃ­ron">AnÃ­ron</a>, and the end title theme "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_It_Be" title="May It Be">May It Be</a>", were composed and sung by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enya" title="Enya">Enya</a>, who allowed her label, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprise_Records" title="Reprise Records">Reprise Records</a>, to release the soundtrack to this and its two sequels. In addition to this, Shore composed "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Dreams_(Howard_Shore_song)" title="In Dreams (Howard Shore song)">In Dreams</a>", which was sung by Edward Ross of the London Oratory School Schola.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> was released on 19 December 2001 in 3,359 cinemas where it grossed $47.2Â million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $314.7Â million in North America and $555.9Â million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $870.7Â million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> received universal acclaim from most major film critics and was one of the best reviewed films of 2001, receiving 92% positive reviews on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, "Peter Jackson ... has made a work for, and of, our times. It will be embraced, I suspect, by many Tolkien fans and take on aspects of a cult. It is a candidate for many Oscars. It is an awesome production in its daring and breadth, and there are small touches that are just right". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a> also gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, "this movie version of a beloved book should please devotees as well as the uninitiated". In his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Mitchell" title="Elvis Mitchell">Elvis Mitchell</a> wrote, "The playful spookiness of Mr. Jackson's direction provides a lively, light touch, a gesture that doesn't normally come to mind when Tolkien's name is mentioned". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly" title="Entertainment Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a></i> magazine gave the film an "A" rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, "The cast take to their roles with becoming modesty, certainly, but Jackson also makes it easy for them: His <i>Fellowship</i> flows, never lingering for the sake of admiring its own beauty ... Every detail of which engrossed me. I may have never turned a page of Tolkien, but I know enchantment when I see it".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In her review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i>, Rita Kempley praised the cast, in particular, "Mortensen, as Strider, is a revelation, not to mention downright gorgeous. And McKellen, carrying the burden of thousands of years' worth of the fight against evil, is positively Merlinesque". <i>Time</i> magazine's Richard Corliss praised Jackson's work: "His movie achieves what the best fairy tales do: the creation of an alternate world, plausible and persuasive, where the youngÂ â€” and not only the youngÂ â€” can lose themselves. And perhaps, in identifying with the little Hobbit that could, find their better selves". In his review for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village_Voice" title="Village Voice">Village Voice</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Hoberman" title="J. Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a> wrote, "Peter Jackson's adaptation is certainly successful on its own terms". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> magazine's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Travers" title="Peter Travers">Peter Travers</a> wrote, "It's emotion that makes <i>Fellowship</i> stick hard in the memory ... Jackson deserves to revel in his success. He's made a three-hour film that leaves you wanting more". However, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, Peter Bradshaw wrote, "there is a strange paucity of plot complication, an absence of anything unfolding, all the more disconcerting because of the clotted and indigestible mythic back story that we have to wade through before anything happens at all. .</p>
