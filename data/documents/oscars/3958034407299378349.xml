	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>Vera Drake</b></i> is a 2004 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Cinema of the United Kingdom">British film</a> directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Leigh" title="Mike Leigh">Mike Leigh</a>. It tells the story of a working class woman in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> in 1950 who performs illegal abortions for women in need. It won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Lion" title="Golden Lion">Golden Lion</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice_Film_Festival" title="Venice Film Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> and it was nominated for three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> and won three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTAs" title="BAFTAs">BAFTAs</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vera Drake (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imelda_Staunton" title="Imelda Staunton">Imelda Staunton</a>) is tirelessly devoted to her family, looking after her husband and children, her elderly mother, and a sick neighbour. Vera's daughter Ethel (Alex Kelly) works in a lightbulb factory, and Vera's son Sid (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Mays" title="Daniel Mays">Daniel Mays</a>) tailors men's suits. Her husband Stanley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Davis_(actor)" title="Phil Davis (actor)">Phil Davis</a>) is a car mechanic. Although Vera and her family do not live lavishly, their strong family bonds hold them together, and Vera's constant small acts of kindness to the many people she encounters throughout her day are touching.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vera works as a house cleaner. However, unbeknownst to her family, she also serves as a backroom <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortionist</a>. She receives no money for this, believing her help to be an act of generosity. However, her partner Lily (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Sheen" title="Ruth Sheen">Ruth Sheen</a>), a hard-bitten wheeler-dealer, who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas (GBÂ£48 in 2005) for arranging the abortions, without Vera's knowledge.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To illustrate the contrast between the classes, the film also contains a sub-plot about a character named Susan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Hawkins" title="Sally Hawkins">Sally Hawkins</a>), the daughter of one of Vera's upper-class employers. Susan is raped by her date one evening, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. The doctor first refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can recommend an abortion on legal grounds; i.e. that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The abortion costs her a hundred guineas (GBÂ£2400 in 2005).</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vera is bailed to appear at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bailey" title="Old Bailey">Old Bailey</a> in a few weeks time. None of Vera's employers will give her a character reference. Her solicitor thinks she will receive the minimum sentence of 18 months in jail; the judge eventually sentences her to two and a half years imprisonment. This has a devastating effect on all the people who rely on Vera to visit them.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Background">Background</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>Vera Drake</i>, Leigh incorporated elements of his own childhood. He grew up in north <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salford,_Greater_Manchester" title="Salford, Greater Manchester">Salford</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancashire" title="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, and experienced a very ordinary but socio-economically mixed life as the son of a doctor and a midwife. In the book <i>The Cinema of Mike Leigh: A Sense of the Real</i>, Leigh said, "I lived in this particular kind of working-class district with some relations living in slightly leafier districts up the road. So there was always a tension, or at least a duality: those two worlds were forever colliding. So you constantly get the one world and its relationship with the other going on in my films".</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mike Leigh is known to use unusual methods to achieve realism in his films. "Leighâ€™s actors literally have to find their characters through improvisation and research the ways people in specific communities speak and behave. Leigh and his cast immerse themselves in the local life before creating the story" (1994: 7: Watson 29). Critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> explains:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leigh often uses improvisation in order to capture his actors' unscripted emotions. When filming <i>Vera Drake</i>, only Imelda Staunton knew ahead of time that the subject of the film was abortion. None of the cast members playing the family members, including Staunton, knew that Vera was to be arrested until the moment the actors playing the police knocked on the door of the house they were using for rehearsals. Their genuine reactions of shock and confusion provided the raw material for their dialogue and actions.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Themes">Themes</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this film, as in other Leigh works, such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Hopes_(film)" title="High Hopes (film)">High Hopes</a></i>, the audience can observe the different social classes interacting. The Drakes are a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> family, while Stanleyâ€™s brother Frank and his wife Joyce have moved into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class" title="Middle class">middle class</a>. Susan and her mother are <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_class" title="Upper class">upper class</a>. Owing to Susan's social status, she is able to arrange and pay for a safe abortion, while the women assisted by Vera are not.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The importance of family is an ongoing theme in the film. Jim Leach argues that "While Leigh seems to offer a fairly conservative view of gender politics through his recurring female characters who want to become mothers, his films highlight the discrepancy between the ideological emphasis on the importance of family and the actual social conditions that place external and internal pressures on family relationships" (61). In <i>Vera Drake</i> the character of Joyce, Frank's wife, who claims that she wants to become a mother, is also depicted as the most selfish character in the film. Barely middle-class and insecure, she is preoccupied with material wealth and improving her social status. Her response to Vera's arrest is to distance herself from this shame and embarrassment, though her long-awaited pregnancy plays a role in her reaction. Vera's own household, by contrast, is filled with warmth, laughter, and uncomplicated happiness. Vera and Stanley Drake have a strong marriage, and after Veraâ€™s secret emerges, although the family has mixed feelings about what she has done, they remain loyal to her.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Responses">Responses</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a critical success. The website <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which compiles and averages reviews from leading film critics, gave it a score of 83 out of 100. Review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reports the film as holding an overall 92% approval rating based on 155 reviews, with a rating average of 7.9 out of 10. The site's general consensus is that,"with a piercingly powerful performance by Imelda Staunton, <i>Vera Drake</i> brings teeming humanity to the controversial subject of abortion."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As of 9 April 2006, <i>Vera Drake</i> had grossed $12,941,817 at the box office worldwide, including over $3.7 million in the U.S.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has attracted some criticism from those who worked in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midwifery" title="Midwifery">midwifery</a> during the 1950s. The chief concern is the method of abortion used by Vera Drake in the film. This involves using a Higginson bulb <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syringe" title="Syringe">syringe</a> filled with a solution of warm, soapy water and disinfectant, which is inserted into the woman's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus" title="Uterus">uterus</a>. This method is claimed by Jennifer Worth, a nurse and midwife in the 1950s and 1960s, to be invariably fatal. She calls the film itself "dangerous", as it could be shown in countries where abortion is illegal and the method depicted copied by desperate women.</p>
