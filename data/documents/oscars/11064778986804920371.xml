Despite escaping the critical mauling, Pfeiffer's agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that "she couldn't get any jobs. Nobody wanted to hire her."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One critic described this film as "one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star."</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Fabulous Baker Boys, Jack (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>) and Frank (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Bridges" title="Beau Bridges">Beau Bridges</a>), are brothers living in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, making a living playing in lounges and music bars, their gimmick being that they play intricate jazz&amp;pop-flavored duets on matching grand pianos. Frank handles the business aspect while Jack, single, attractive, and more talented as a player, feels disillusioned and bored with the often hackneyed material they play. He is, nonetheless, able to live a comfortable and responsibility-free existence because of Frank's management, sleeping where and with whom he pleases. Frank has a wife and family he adores, but Jack has no personal connections in his private life, other than Eddie, his soulful but aging Black Labrador, and Nina, the lonely child of a single mom living in his building, who walks Eddie and takes piano lessons from Jack. In all other respects, professionally and personally, Jack's life is a series of empty one night stands. Now and again, he plays the challenging music he really cares about at a local jazz club.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Concerned over the way they keep losing gigs, the Baker Boys hold auditions for a female singer to join the outfit, ending up with the beautiful but eccentric Susie Diamond (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>), a former escort with unusual charisma, a sultry singing voice, and emotional baggage she keeps well hidden most of the time. She's late for the audition, cockily irreverent of their professional reputation, and ticks Frank off by saying she's got an intuition he'll hire her anyway--but overcomes his reservations with her impassioned performance of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_Than_You_Know_(1929_song)" title="More Than You Know (1929 song)">More Than You Know</a>", with Jack accompanying her--clearly more impressed with Susie's singing (and Susie herself) than he wants to admit. After a rocky start, the new act becomes unexpectedly successful, leading to bigger gigs and better money, but Frank is worried that Jack will ruin it by sleeping with Susie, having noted the growing attraction between the two, and being all too well aware of his brother's effect on the opposite sex.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The now sought-after trio (and Eddie, still recovering from surgery) head out of town to play an extended engagement at The Mallory, a grand old-style hotel. Frank has to leave suddenly, when one of his kids has a minor accident. Without him to act as chaperone, Susie and Jack give in to their feelings after playing a sizzling duet of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makin%27_Whoopee" title="Makin' Whoopee">Makin' Whoopee</a>" at the hotel's New Year's Eve celebration. Before they have sex, Susie opens up to Jack about her past at the escort service, sleeping with clients simply because they were nice to her. She tries to tell him how good a player he is, but he's unwilling to open up to her about his regrets, as she did with him. The romance is uneasy and off-kilter from the start, and it doesn't last long.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in Seattle, there is increasing tension within the act, as Frank senses what has happened between Jack and Susie, and both of them begin to rebel against Frank's creative control, which has them performing crowd-pleasers like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feelings_(song)" title="Feelings (song)">"Feelings"</a> every night, instead of the jazz standards they prefer. After she spends the night with Jack at his apartment (leading to an embarrassing encounter with Nina), Susie reveals that she got a lucrative offer from a catfood conventioneer at The Mallory to sing jingles for TV, which would mean leaving The Baker Boys. She later takes the job when Jack, wounded she'd even consider going (and thinking about the conventioneers she used to know as an escort), refuses to admit how he feels about her, and acts as if her departure is no big deal, basically calling her a whore. As a parting shot, she tells him he's selling himself on the cheap as much as she ever did as an escort, by working a cheesy lounge act instead of developing his talent as a serious jazz musician--and it's evident from his reaction that she's scored a bullseye.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Now ready to pursue the solo career his loyalty to Frank and delayed maturity had kept on the back burner, Jack goes to Frank's house to mend fences. The brothers finally let each other know how much they care about each other, now that they don't have to work together. Frank accepts Jack's decision to go his own way, and says he'll switch to giving piano lessons at home--in his mind, he was simply helping his brother lead the carefree swinging single life that he secretly envied, and had thought Jack wanted. They reminisce happily about the early days of their act, and play a riotous chorus of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27re_Sixteen" title="You're Sixteen">You're Sixteen</a>", knowing now that their connection is unbreakable, no matter what happens.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack goes to see Susie, who is not enjoying the jingle business much, to let her know he's sorry about the way he behaved, and to subtly but unmistakably communicate that he wants to try again with her. She isn't ready to give him another chance yet, but they part as friends, and Jack tells her he's got an intuition they'll see each other again, echoing her earlier prediction that the brothers would hire her for the act. She walks off to her job, with him watching until she's nearly out of sight. As the credits roll, the soundtrack plays Michelle Pfeiffer and Dave Grusin's interpretation of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Funny_Valentine" title="My Funny Valentine">My Funny Valentine</a>".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kloves" title="Steve Kloves">Steve Kloves</a> wrote <i>The Fabulous Baker Boys</i> after his first script, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_with_the_Moon" title="Racing with the Moon">Racing with the Moon</a></i> (1985) was made into a motion picture. Three years after the screenplay was first acquired for production by Paula Weinstein, the picture was greenlighted by Gladden Entertainment and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Century_Fox" title="Twentieth Century Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> with Kloves directing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> was Kloves's first choice for the role of Jack Baker. "Jeff, for me, is like the old time actors who you never know are acting; he's seamless - you just never see him working at it." Jeff's brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Bridges" title="Beau Bridges">Beau Bridges</a>, was then shown the script, although he admitted he was a "little reluctant since Jeff had initiated it and I didn't want anyone to feel that big brother had been forced upon them. By the time I'd finished reading the script, however, I would have killed to have done it." According to Kloves, "Beau has the most wonderful knack of making memorable moments out of simple gestures."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the plum role of Susie Diamond, actresses such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debra_Winger" title="Debra Winger">Debra Winger</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooke_Shields" title="Brooke Shields">Brooke Shields</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Foster" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Jason_Leigh" title="Jennifer Jason Leigh">Jennifer Jason Leigh</a> were considered. Madonna was highly critical of the finished picture, calling it "too mushy." The role eventually went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>. Kloves was quoted as saying that "Michelle is the icing on the cake. Her Susie Diamond is right on the mark--and she is a wonderful singer. Michelle is an actress with unlimited range." Pfeiffer, despite having already sung on screen in her cinematic dÃ©but, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_2" title="Grease 2">Grease 2</a></i> (1982), was never a professionally-trained singer; she started taking voice lessons two months before filming commenced. Her vocal coach, Sally Stevens, commended her dedication: "She was singing these songs in a very exposed way--no strings or lush orchestrations to hide behind, just a piano. She worked ten hours a day in the studio and then took the tapes home with her to study them." In preparation for the most famous scene, a rendition of '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makin%27_Whoopee" title="Makin' Whoopee">Makin' Whoopee</a>' atop a grand piano that took six hours to film, Pfeiffer only had one choreography lesson, and wore knee and elbow pads during rehearsals.</p>

Rita Kempley in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a></i> wrote that "Kloves is a nostalgic young man whose passion for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Fitzgerald" title="Ella Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a> records, film noir and romantic melodrama mesh in this classic directorial dÃ©but. <i>The Fabulous Baker Boys</i> is like a beloved movie from the glory days of Hollywood. It transports you. It's an American rhapsody." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_(company)" title="Time Out (company)">Time Out</a></i> wrote that "with more than enough witty, well-observed details, it's a little charmer... understatement is crucial to the script's success."  <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> was of the opinion that "<i>The Fabulous Baker Boys</i> doesn't do anything very original, but what it does, it does wonderfully well."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The look and atmosphere of the film were highly praised. The <i>New York Times</i> wrote that the "warm, rich hues of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ballhaus" title="Michael Ballhaus">Michael Ballhaus</a>'s cinematography contribute immeasurably to the film's invitingly intimate glow." <i>Time</i> thought that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kloves" title="Steve Kloves">Steve Kloves</a> and his "fine cinematographer, Michael Ballhaus, have created a gently dislocating noirish mood - not quite menacing but not exactly comfortable either - and let it speak for itself. It is a setting where actors can live and breathe like real people." Desson Howe in the <i>Washington Post</i> wrote that "the man [Ballhaus] who, among many films, shot <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainer_Werner_Fassbinder" title="Rainer Werner Fassbinder">Rainer Werner Fassbinder</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Maria_Braun" title="The Marriage of Maria Braun">The Marriage of Maria Braun</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese" title="Martin Scorsese">Martin Scorsese</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Temptation_of_Christ_(film)" title="The Last Temptation of Christ (film)">The Last Temptation of Christ</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_L._Brooks" title="James L.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Pfeiffer" title="Michelle Pfeiffer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>'s performance drew rave reviews from almost every critic. The <i>New York Times</i> called her "as unexpected a choice for this musical bombshell as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> is for Jack, but, like him, she proves to be electrifyingly right... when Ms. Pfeiffer, draped across Jeff Bridges's piano and setting some new standard for cinematic slinkiness, performs in the above-mentioned New Year's Eve sequence with the camera gliding hypnotically around her, she just plain brings down the house." The <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> wrote of this film as "the movie of her flowering - not just as a beautiful woman, but as an actress with the ability to make you care about her, to make you feel what she feels... Whatever she's doing while she performs that song ['Makin' Whoopee'] isn't merely singing; it's whatever <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rita_Hayworth" title="Rita Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a> did in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilda" title="Gilda">Gilda</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> did in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Like_It_Hot" title="Some Like It Hot">Some Like It Hot</a></i>, and I didn't want her to stop." <i>The New Yorker</i> thought that she recalled "the grinning infectiousness of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Lombard" title="Carole Lombard">Carole Lombard</a>, the radiance of the very young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, and Pfeiffer herself in other movies." <i>Time</i> described her as "a cat with at least nine dimensions ever aflicker in her eyes." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> wrote that "Pfeiffer hits the nail right on the head. She also hits the spot in the film's certain-to-be-remembered highlight - a version of 'Makin' Whoopee' that she sings while crawling all over a piano in a blazing red dress. She's dynamite." The <i>Washington Post</i> described her as "slinky and cynical, more <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Bacall</a> than Bacall. Like the sun through a magnifying glass, she burns an image on the screen."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> and his brother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beau_Bridges" title="Beau Bridges">Beau Bridges</a>, were also acclaimed for their performances. <i>Time</i> thought that "the Bridges boys are better than fabulous in it - Jeff not quite falling over the line into unredeemable cynicism, Beau never succumbing to the pull of moral blandness." <i>The New Yorker</i> wrote that "Jeff Bridges has never been as glamorously beyond reach as he is here." The <i>New York Times</i> thought that "Beau Bridges also has a chance to shine." The <i>Washington Post</i> was of the opinion that "Jeff Bridges, lean, sexy and contemptuous, is more than up to it in this, his best work to date... Beau Bridges, all pudgy and wounded, makes a subtle villain of the fussy, guilt-inflicting Frank."</p>
