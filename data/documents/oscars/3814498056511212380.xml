	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film purports to portray playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s involvement in a love affair at the time that he was writing the play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i>; it is largely fictional, although several of the characters are based on real people. In addition, many of the characters, lines, and plot devices are references to Shakespeare's plays.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film centres around the forbidden love of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Fiennes" title="Joseph Fiennes">Joseph Fiennes</a>) and Viola de Lesseps (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwyneth_Paltrow" title="Gwyneth Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>), the daughter of a wealthy merchant.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film begins with theatre manager <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Henslowe" title="Philip Henslowe">Philip Henslowe</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Rush" title="Geoffrey Rush">Geoffrey Rush</a>) being strong-armed to pay a debt he owes to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_shark" title="Loan shark">loan shark</a> Hugh Fennyman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Wilkinson" title="Tom Wilkinson">Tom Wilkinson</a>). Henslowe offers Fennyman a partnership in the upcoming production of Shakespeare's newest <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_comedy" title="Shakespearean comedy">comedy</a> â€” <i>Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter</i> â€” promising that it will be a hit. The playwright, however, burns the original play and tries to start anew after learning that his love and inspiration was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">cheating</a> on him with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Tylney" title="Edmund Tylney">Edmund Tilney</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Callow" title="Simon Callow">Simon Callow</a>), the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Revels" title="Master of the Revels">Master of the Revels</a>. Suffering from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writer%27s_block" title="Writer's block">writer's block</a>, Will Shakespeare is unable to complete the play, but begins auditions for Romeo, planning to write the play as the actors rehearse. A young man named Thomas Kent is cast in the role after impressing Shakespeare with his performance and his love of Shakespeare's previous work. Unknown to Shakespeare and the rest of the theatre company, Kent is young Viola de Lesseps, who desires to act, but since women are barred from the stage, she must disguise herself as a young man to fulfill her dream. This play will later be renamed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i> and be reworked into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespearean_tragedy" title="Shakespearean tragedy">tragedy</a> (but with some comical undertones with a few characters, like the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurse_(Romeo_and_Juliet)" title="Nurse (Romeo and Juliet)">Nurse</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Shakespeare discovers his leading man's true identity, he and Viola begin a passionate secret affair. There are strong parallels between the pair's romance and the one in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, including the ballroom scene from Act 2 and the balcony scene immediately following it. The element of forbidden love forms the basis of Shakespeare's inspiration, and many of their conversations later show up as some of the most famous quotes in the play.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inspired by Viola, Shakespeare begins writing feverishly. His work in progress also benefits from the off-hand advice of playwright and friendly rival <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher 'Kit' Marlowe</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupert_Everett" title="Rupert Everett">Rupert Everett</a>), whose own murder is cleverly worked into the plot later on. Yet Shakespeare and de Lesseps know that their romance is doomed. Shakespeare is married, albeit long separated from his wife, while Viola's parents have arranged her betrothal to Lord Wessex (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Firth" title="Colin Firth">Colin Firth</a>), an aristocrat who has agreed to marry the social-climbing merchant's daughter in view of his own mounting debts and lack of cash. When Viola is summoned to the court of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_I" title="Queen Elizabeth I">Queen Elizabeth I</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judi_Dench" title="Judi Dench">Judi Dench</a>), Shakespeare dons a woman's disguise to accompany her as her country cousin. At court, Shakespeare goads Wessex into betting fifty pounds that a play cannot capture the nature of true <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a>. If <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> is a success, Shakespeare as playwright will win the money. The Queen, who enjoys Shakespeare's plays, agrees to witness the wager. The meeting's true purpose is revealed when Wessex announces his intent to marry Viola.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Tylney" title="Edmund Tylney">Edmund Tilney</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Callow" title="Simon Callow">Simon Callow</a>), the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Revels" title="Master of the Revels">Master of the Revels</a>, the Queen's official in charge of the theatres, learns that there is a woman in the theatre company at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rose_(theatre)" title="The Rose (theatre)">the Rose</a> playhouse. He orders the theatre closed for violating morality and the law. Left without a stage or lead actor, it seems that <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> must close before it even opens, until <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burbage" title="Richard Burbage">Richard Burbage</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Clunes" title="Martin Clunes">Martin Clunes</a>), the owner of a competing theatre, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtain_Theatre" title="Curtain Theatre">the Curtain</a>, offers his stage to Shakespeare. Shakespeare assumes the lead role of Romeo, with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_player" title="Boy player">boy actor</a> playing Juliet. Viola learns the play will be performed on her wedding day. After the ceremony, Viola's loyal nurse (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imelda_Staunton" title="Imelda Staunton">Imelda Staunton</a>) helps her slip away to the theatre. In a final twist, shortly before the play begins, the boy playing Juliet begins to experience the voice change of puberty. Viola takes the stage to replace him and plays Juliet to Shakespeare's Romeo, and their passionate portrayal of two lovers inspires the entire audience.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, even a queen is powerless to break a lawful marriage. Queen Elizabeth orders "Thomas Kent" to fetch Viola so that she may sail with Wessex to a colonial settlement in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia" title="Colony of Virginia">Virginia</a>. The queen also states that <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> has accurately portrayed true love, so Wessex is forced to pay Shakespeare the fifty pounds, the exact amount Shakespeare requires to buy a share in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chamberlain%27s_Men" title="Lord Chamberlain's Men">Chamberlain's Men</a>. The Queen then directs "Kent" to tell Shakespeare to write something "a little more cheerful next time, for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night_(holiday)" title="Twelfth Night (holiday)">Twelfth Night</a>". Viola and Shakespeare part, resigned to their fates.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inspired by Viola and their final goodbye, Shakespeare begins his new story, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night, Or What You Will</a></i>, with a sinking ship, its sole survivor a lady "whose soul is greater than the ocean." A scene of her walking on the beach closes the film with a voice over by Shakespeare musing of its main character, "For she will be my heroine for all time, and her name will be . . . <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola_(Twelfth_Night_character)" title="Viola (Twelfth Night character)">Viola</a>", whom he depicts in the play as a strong young woman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castaway" title="Castaway">castaway</a> who falls in love with the Duke of Illyria while disguised as a young man.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The original idea for <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> came to screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Norman" title="Marc Norman">Marc Norman</a> in the late 1980s. He pitched a draft screenplay to director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Zwick" title="Ed Zwick">Ed Zwick</a>. The screenplay attracted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts" title="Julia Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> who agreed to play Viola. However, Zwick disliked Norman's screenplay and hired the playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Stoppard" title="Tom Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a> to improve it (Stoppard's first major success had been with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare" title="William Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>-influenced play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosencrantz_%26_Guildenstern_Are_Dead" title="Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead">Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead</a></i>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film went into production in 1991 at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Pictures</a>, with Zwick as director, but although sets and costumes were in construction, Shakespeare had not yet been cast, because Julia Roberts insisted that only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Day-Lewis" title="Daniel Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> could play the role. Day-Lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to persuade him, she withdrew from the film, six weeks before shooting was due to begin. The production went into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnaround_(film_industry_term)" title="Turnaround (film industry term)">turnaround</a>, and Zwick was unable to persuade other studios to take up the screenplay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eventually, Zwick interested <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax_Films" title="Miramax Films">Miramax</a> in the screenplay, but Miramax was not keen on him as director, and froze him out of the project, choosing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Madden_(director)" title="John Madden (director)">John Madden</a> instead. Miramax boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein" title="Harvey Weinstein">Harvey Weinstein</a> acted as producer, and successfully persuaded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Affleck" title="Ben Affleck">Ben Affleck</a> to take a small role as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Alleyn" title="Ned Alleyn">Ned Alleyn</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was considerably reworked after the first test screenings. The scene with Shakespeare and Viola in the punt was re-shot, to make it more emotional, and some lines were re-recorded to clarify the reasons why Viola had to marry Wessex. The ending was reshot several times, until Stoppard eventually came up with the idea of Viola suggesting to Shakespeare that their parting could inspire his next play.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The main source for much of the action in the film is <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romeo_and_Juliet" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>.</i> Will and Viola play out the famous balcony and bedroom scenes; like Juliet, Viola has a witty nurse, and is separated from Will by a gulf of duty (although not the family enmity of the play: the "two households" of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> are supposedly inspired by the two rival playhouses). In addition, the two lovers are equally "star-crossed" â€” they are not ultimately destined to be together (since Viola is of rich and socially ambitious merchant stock and is promised to marry <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Wessex#Fiction" title="Earl of Wessex">Lord Wessex</a>, while Shakespeare himself is poor and already married). There is also a Rosaline, with whom Will is in love at the beginning of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many other plot devices used in the film are common in various Shakespearean comedies and in the works of the other playwrights of the Elizabethan era: the Queen disguised as a commoner, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-dressing" title="Cross-dressing">cross-dressing</a> disguises, mistaken identities, the sword fight, the suspicion of adultery (or, at least, cheating), the appearance of a "ghost" (cf. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macbeth" title="Macbeth">Macbeth</a></i>), and the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_within_a_play" title="Play within a play">play within a play</a>".</p>

I say, a plague on both their houses!" Two references in one, both to <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; first, "A rose by any other name would smell as sweet" (Act II, scene ii, lines 1 and 2); second, "a plague on both your houses" (Act III, scene I, line 94).</li>
	<li>Backstage of a performance of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona" title="The Two Gentlemen of Verona">The Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></i>, Shakespeare sees <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kempe" title="William Kempe">William Kempe</a> in full make-up, silently contemplating a skull, a reference to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet" title="Hamlet">Hamlet</a></i>.</li>
	<li>Shakespeare utters the lines "Doubt thou the stars are fire, / Doubt that the sun doth move" (from <i>Hamlet</i>) to Philip Henslowe.</li>
	<li>As Shakespeare's writer's block is introduced, he is seen crumpling balls of paper and throwing them around his room. They land near props which represent scenes in his several plays: a skull (<i>Hamlet</i>), and an open chest (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merchant_of_Venice" title="The Merchant of Venice">The Merchant of Venice</a></i>).</li>
	<li>Viola, as well as being Paltrow's name in the film, is the lead character in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night</a></i> who dresses as a man after the supposed death of her brother.</li>
	<li>At the end of the film, Shakespeare imagines a shipwreck overtaking Viola on her way to America, inspiring the second scene of his next play, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_Night" title="Twelfth Night">Twelfth Night</a></i>, and perhaps also <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest" title="The Tempest">The Tempest</a></i>.</li>
	<li>Shakespeare writes a sonnet to Viola which begins: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" (from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonnet_18" title="Sonnet 18">Sonnet 18</a>).</li>
	<li>Shakespeare tells Henslowe that he still owes him for "one gentleman of Verona", a reference to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Gentlemen_of_Verona" title="Two Gentlemen of Verona">Two Gentlemen of Verona</a></i>, part of which we also see being acted before the Queen later in the film.</li>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Marlowe" title="Christopher Marlowe">Christopher Marlowe</a> appears in the film as the master playwright whom the characters within the film consider the greatest English dramatist of that time â€” this is accurate, yet also humorous, since everyone in the film's audience knows what will eventually happen to Shakespeare. Marlowe gives Shakespeare a plot for his next play, "Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter" ("Romeo is Italian...always in and out of love...until he meets...Ethel. The daughter of his enemy! His best friend is killed in a duel by Ethel's brother or something. His name is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercutio" title="Mercutio">Mercutio</a>.") Marlowe's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tragical_History_of_Doctor_Faustus" title="The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus">Doctor Faustus</a></i> is quoted repeatedly: "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships/ And burned the topless towers of Ilium?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The child <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Webster" title="John Webster">John Webster</a> who plays with mice is a reference to the leading figure in the Jacobean generation of playwrights. His plays (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Duchess_of_Malfi" title="The Duchess of Malfi">The Duchess of Malfi</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Devil" title="The White Devil">The White Devil</a></i>) are known for their blood and gore, which is why he says that he enjoys <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus_Andronicus" title="Titus Andronicus">Titus Andronicus</a></i>, and why he says of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> when asked by the Queen "I liked it when she stabbed herself."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the clown <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Kempe" title="William Kempe">Will Kempe</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Barlow" title="Patrick Barlow">Patrick Barlow</a>) says to Shakespeare that he would like to play in a drama, he is told that "they would laugh at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger" title="Seneca the Younger">Seneca</a> if you played it," a reference to the Roman tragedian renowned for his sombre and bloody plot lines which were a major influence on the development of English tragedy.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The writers of <i>Shakespeare in Love</i> were sued in 1999 by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Kellerman" title="Faye Kellerman">Faye Kellerman</a>, author of the book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quality_of_Mercy_(book)" title="The Quality of Mercy (book)">The Quality of Mercy</a></i>. Kellerman claimed that the story was lifted from her book, a detective novel in which Shakespeare and a cross-dressing Jewish woman attempt to solve a murder. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax" title="Miramax">Miramax</a> derided the claim of similarity as an "absurd...publicity stunt". After the film's release, certain publications, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Eye" title="Private Eye">Private Eye</a></i>, noted strong similarities between the film and the 1941 novel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=No_Bed_for_Bacon&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="No Bed for Bacon (page does not exist)">No Bed for Bacon</a></i>, by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryl_Brahms" title="Caryl Brahms">Caryl Brahms</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_J_Simon" title="S J Simon">S J Simon</a>, which also features Shakespeare falling in love and finding inspiration for his later plays. In a foreword to a subsequent edition of <i>No Bed for Bacon</i> (which traded on the association by declaring itself "A Story of Shakespeare and Lady Viola in Love") <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Sherrin" title="Ned Sherrin">Ned Sherrin</a>, <i>Private Eye</i> insider and former writing partner of Brahms', confirmed that he had lent a copy of the novel to Stoppard after he joined the writing team, but that the basic plot of the film had been independently developed by Marc Norman, who was unaware of the earlier work.</p>
