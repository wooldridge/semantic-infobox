The IRA demands the release of other jailed IRA members, threatening to execute Jody in three days if their demands are not met.

However, Jody knows that Fergus is no murderer at heart, and makes a break for it. Sure enough, Fergus cannot bring himself to shoot the fleeing Jody in the back, but Jody is instead accidentally run over and killed by British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armoured_personnel_carrier" title="Armoured personnel carrier">armoured personnel carriers</a> as they suddenly move in to assault the IRA safehouse.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jordan first drafted the screenplay for <i>The Crying Game</i> in the mid-1980s under the title <i>The Soldier's Wife</i>, but shelved the project after a similar film was released. He sought to begin production of the film in the early nineties, but found it difficult to secure financing. Potential investors were discouraged by his recent string of box office flops, as well as the difficult themes of the script.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film went into production with an inadequate patchwork of funding, leading to a stressful and unstable filming process. The producers constantly searched for small amounts of money to keep the production going and pay disgruntled crew members. The film was known as <i>The Soldier's Wife</i> for much of the production, but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kubrick" title="Stanley Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> who was a friend of Neil Jordan, counselled against the title saying that audiences would expect a war film.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The then-fledgling film company <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax" title="Miramax">Miramax</a> decided to promote the film in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a> where it became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeper_hit" title="Sleeper hit">sleeper hit</a>, earning nearly $60 million at the box office. A memorable advertising campaign generated intense public curiosity by asking audiences not to reveal the film's "secret" to their friends. Jordan also believed the film's success was a result of the film's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles" title="The Troubles">British/Irish political issues</a> being either lesser-known or completely unknown to American audiences, who thus flocked to the film for what Jordan called "the sexual politics."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film won critical acclaim and went on to be nominated for six <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>, including Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Actor in a Leading Role (for Rea), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Davidson) and Best Director.
