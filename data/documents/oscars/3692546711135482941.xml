	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benigni was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manciano_La_Misericordia" title="Manciano La Misericordia">Manciano La Misericordia</a>, (a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazione" title="Frazione">frazione</a></i> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castiglion_Fiorentino" title="Castiglion Fiorentino">Castiglion Fiorentino</a>), Italy, the son of Isolina Papini, a fabric inspector, and Remigio Benigni, a bricklayer, carpenter, and farmer. He was raised <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" title="Catholic Church">Catholic</a> and served as an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altar_boy" title="Altar boy">altar boy</a>. His first experiences as a theatre actor took place in 1971, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prato" title="Prato">Prato</a>. During that autumn he moved to Rome where he took part in some experimental theatre shows, some of which he also directed. In 1975, Benigni had his first theatrical success with <i>Cioni Mario di Gaspare fu Giulia</i>, written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Giuseppe_Bertolucci&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Giuseppe Bertolucci (page does not exist)">Giuseppe Bertolucci</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benigni became famous in Italy in the 1970s for a shocking TV series called <i>Onda Libera</i>, on RAI2, by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzo_Arbore" title="Renzo Arbore">Renzo Arbore</a>, in which he interpreted the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satirical" title="Satirical">satirical</a> piece "anthem of the melt body" (<i>L'inno del corpo sciolto</i>, a hymn to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defecation" title="Defecation">defecation</a>). A great scandal for the time, the series was suspended due to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship" title="Censorship">censorship</a>. His first film was 1977's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Berlinguer_ti_voglio_bene&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Berlinguer ti voglio bene (page does not exist)">Berlinguer ti voglio bene</a></i>, also by Giuseppe Bertolucci.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Afterwards, he appeared during a public political demonstration by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Communist_Party" title="Italian Communist Party">Italian Communist Party</a>, with which he was a sympathiser, and on this occasion he took in his arms and dangled the national leader <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Berlinguer" title="Enrico Berlinguer">Enrico Berlinguer</a>, a very serious figure. It was an unprecedented act, given that until that moment Italian politicians were proverbially serious and formal. It represented a breaking point, after which politicians experimented with newer habits and "public manners", attended fewer formal events and, generally speaking, modified their lifestyle in order to exhibit a more popular behaviour. Benigni was censored again in the 1980s for calling the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_John_Paul_II" title="Pope John Paul II">Pope John Paul II</a> something impolite during an important live TV show ("Wojtylaccio", meaning "Bad Wojtyla" in Italian).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His popularity increased with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=L%27altra_domenica&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="L'altra domenica (page does not exist)">L'altra domenica</a></i> (1978), another TV show by Arbore in which Benigni portrays a lazy film critic who never watches the films he's asked to review. Then <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci" title="Bernardo Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a> cast him in a small speechless role as a window upholsterer in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Luna_(film)" title="La Luna (film)">La Luna</a></i> which evaded American distribution due to its subject matter.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="1980s">1980s</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1980 he met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesena" title="Cesena">Cesenate</a> actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoletta_Braschi" title="Nicoletta Braschi">Nicoletta Braschi</a>, who was to become his wife and who has starred in most of the films he directed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benigni's first film as director was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tu_mi_turbi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Tu mi turbi (page does not exist)">Tu mi turbi</a></i> (<i>You upset me</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_in_film" title="1983 in film">1983</a>). This film was also his first collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoletta_Braschi" title="Nicoletta Braschi">Nicoletta Braschi</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1984, he played in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_ci_resta_che_piangere" title="Non ci resta che piangere">Non ci resta che piangere</a></i> ("Nothing left to do but cry") with the very popular comic actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Troisi" title="Massimo Troisi">Massimo Troisi</a>. The story was a fable in which the protagonists are suddenly thrown back in time to the 15th century, just a little before 1492. They start looking for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Columbus</a> in order to stop him from discovering the Americas (although for very personal love reasons), but are not able to reach him.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Beginning in 1986, Benigni starred in three films by American director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jarmusch" title="Jim Jarmusch">Jim Jarmusch</a>. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_by_Law_(film)" title="Down by Law (film)">Down By Law</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_in_film" title="1986 in film">1986</a>) (which in Italy had its title spelled "DaunbailÃ²", in Italian phonetics) he played Bob, the innocent abroad, convicted for manslaughter, whose irrepressible good humour and optimism help him escape and find love (also starring Braschi as his beloved.) In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_on_Earth_(film)" title="Night on Earth (film)">Night on Earth</a></i>, (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1991_in_film" title="1991 in film">1991</a>) he plays a cabbie in Rome, causing his passenger, a priest, great discomfort and a heart attack by confessing his bizarre sexual experiences. Later, he also starred in the first of Jarmusch's series of short films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_and_Cigarettes" title="Coffee and Cigarettes">Coffee and Cigarettes</a></i> (2003).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1993, he starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Son_of_the_Pink_Panther" title="Son of the Pink Panther">Son of the Pink Panther</a></i>, directed by veteran <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Edwards" title="Blake Edwards">Blake Edwards</a>. There, he played <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers" title="Peter Sellers">Peter Sellers</a>' Inspector Clouseau's illegitimate son who is assigned to save the Princess of Lugash. The film bombed in the US, but was a hit in Italy, his home country.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A serious role was in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federico_Fellini" title="Federico Fellini">Federico Fellini</a>'s last film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_voce_della_luna" title="La voce della luna">La voce della luna</a></i> (1989). In earlier years Benigni had started a long-lasting collaboration with screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vincenzo_Cerami&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Vincenzo Cerami (page does not exist)">Vincenzo Cerami</a>, for a series of films which scored great success in Italy: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Il_piccolo_diavolo" title="Il piccolo diavolo">Il piccolo diavolo</a></i> ("The little devil", with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Matthau" title="Walter Matthau">Walter Matthau</a>), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Stecchino" title="Johnny Stecchino">Johnny Stecchino</a></i> ("Johnny Toothpick"), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_(1994_film)" title="The Monster (1994 film)">Il mostro</a></i> ("The Monster").</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Life_Is_Beautiful_and_beyond"><i>Life Is Beautiful</i> and beyond</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benigni is probably best known outside Italy for his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_in_film" title="1999 in film">1997</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragicomedy" title="Tragicomedy">tragicomedy</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_Is_Beautiful" title="Life Is Beautiful">Life Is Beautiful</a></i> (<i>La vita Ã¨ bella</i>), filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arezzo" title="Arezzo">Arezzo</a>, also written by Cerami. The film is about an Italian Jewish man who tries to protect his son's innocence during his internment at a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism" title="Nazism">Nazi</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a>, by telling him that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> is an elaborate game and he must adhere very carefully to the rules to win. Benigni's father had spent three years in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergen-Belsen_concentration_camp" title="Bergen-Belsen concentration camp">Bergen-Belsen</a>, and <i>La vita Ã¨ bella</i> is based in part on his father's experiences. Although the story and presentation of the film had been discussed during production with different Jewish groups to limit the offense it might cause, the film was attacked by many critics who accused it of presenting the Holocaust without much suffering, and some who considered that "laughing at everything" was not remotely appropriate, let alone credible. More favorable critics praised Benigni's artistic daring and skill to create a sensitive comedy involving the tragedy, a challenge that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Chaplin" title="Charles Chaplin">Charles Chaplin</a> confessed he would not have done with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Dictator" title="The Great Dictator">The Great Dictator</a></i> had he been aware of the horrors of the Holocaust.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1998, the film was nominated for seven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>. At the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/71st_Academy_Awards" title="71st Academy Awards">1999 ceremony</a> Benigni received the award for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a> (the first for a male performer in a non-English-speaking role, and only the third overall acting Oscar for non-English-speaking roles), the score by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Piovani" title="Nicola Piovani">Nicola Piovani</a> won <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Music_(Scoring)#1990s" title="Academy Award for Best Music (Scoring)">Best Original Dramatic Score</a>, and the film was awarded the Oscar for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film" title="Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film">Best Foreign Language Film</a>, which Benigni accepted as the film's director.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Famously, in the midst of being so giddy with delight after <i>Life Is Beautiful</i> was announced as the Best Foreign Film, Benigni climbed over and then stood on the backs of the seats in front of him and applauded the audience before proceeding to the stage. And after winning his Best Actor Oscar later in the evening, he said in his acceptance speech, "There must be some terrible mistake, I used up all my English!" At the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/72nd_Academy_Awards" title="72nd Academy Awards">following year's ceremony</a>, when he read the nominees for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress</a> (won by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Swank" title="Hilary Swank">Hilary Swank</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_Don%27t_Cry_(film)" title="Boys Don't Cry (film)">Boys Don't Cry</a></i>), host <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Crystal" title="Billy Crystal">Billy Crystal</a> playfully appeared behind him with a large net to restrain Benigni if he got excessive with his antics again.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Benigni played one of the main characters in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix_and_Obelix_vs_Caesar" title="Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar">Asterix and Obelix vs Caesar</a></i> as Detritus, a corrupted Roman tax collector who wants to kill Julius Caesar, thereby seizing control of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a>.</p>

Prior to removing his shirt, Benigni had already hijacked the opening credits of the news program, jumping behind the newscaster and announcing: "Berlusconi has resigned" (Benigni is an outspoken critic of media tycoon and then former Prime Minister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvio_Berlusconi" title="Silvio Berlusconi">Silvio Berlusconi</a>).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 2 February 2007, he was awarded the degree of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Degree" title="Honorary Degree">Doctor Honoris Causa</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katholieke_Universiteit_Leuven" title="Katholieke Universiteit Leuven">Katholieke Universiteit Leuven</a>, Belgium.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During 2006 and 2007, Benigni had a lot of success touring Italy with his 90-minute "one man show" show <i>TuttoDante</i> ("Everything About <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante" title="Dante">Dante</a>").

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first half of the movie is a whimsical, romantic, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a> comedy set in the years before <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Guido Orefice (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Benigni" title="Roberto Benigni">Roberto Benigni</a>), a young Italian Jew, arrives in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arezzo" title="Arezzo">Arezzo</a> where he plans to set up a bookstore, taking a job in the interim as a waiter at his uncle's hotel.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guido is both funny and charismatic, especially when he romances a local school teacher, Dora (portrayed by Benigni's actual wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicoletta_Braschi" title="Nicoletta Braschi">Nicoletta Braschi</a>). Dora, however comes from a wealthy, aristocratic, non-Jewish Italian family. Dora's mother wants her to marry a well-to-do civil servant, but Dora falls instead for Guido where he ends up stealing her away at her engagement party from her aristocratic but arrogant fiancÃ©.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several years pass in which Guido and Dora marry and have a son, GiosuÃ© (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgio_Cantarini" title="Giorgio Cantarini">Giorgio Cantarini</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dora and her mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marisa_Paredes" title="Marisa Paredes">Marisa Paredes</a>) are estranged due to the unequal marriage. Later on, a reconciliation takes place just prior to Giosue's fourth birthday.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the second half of the film, The Second World War has already begun. Guido, Uncle Eliseo, and GiosuÃ© are forced onto a train and taken to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camp</a> on GiosuÃ©'s birthday. Dora demands to be on the same train to join her family and is permitted to do so.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the camp, Guido hides his son from the Nazi guards, sneaks him food, and tries to humor him. In an attempt to keep up GiosuÃ©'s spirits, Guido convinces him that the camp is just a game, in which the first person to get 1,000 points wins a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank" title="Tank">tank</a>. He tells him that if he cries, complains that he wants his mother, or says that he is hungry, he will lose points, while quiet boys who hide from the camp guards earn 1,000 points.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Guido maintains this story right until the end, whenâ€”in the chaos caused by the American advanceâ€”he tells his son to stay in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Box_(torture)" title="The Box (torture)">sweatbox</a> until everybody has left, this being the final test before the tank is his. After trying to find Dora, Guido is caught, taken away and shot dead by a Nazi guard, but not before making his son laugh one last time by imitating the Nazi guard as if the two of them are marching around the camp together.</p>
