      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Steven Allan Spielberg</b> (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, film producer, video game designer and studio executive. In a career spanning four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the founders of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> movie studio.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i> (1993) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i> (1998). Three of Spielberg's films; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> (1975), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i> (1982), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (1993), achieved <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">box office</a> records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5Â billion worldwide. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0Â billion.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother Leah Adler was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and father Arnold Spielberg was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. He spent his childhood in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Heights,_New_Jersey" title="Haddon Heights, New Jersey">Haddon Heights, New Jersey</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8Â mm "adventure" films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)">Boy Scout</a>, and fulfilled a requirement for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)">photography merit badge</a> by making a nine-minute 8Â mm film entitled <i>The Last Gunfight</i>. Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started." At age 13, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled <i>Escape to Nowhere</i> which was based on a battle in east Africa. In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firelight_(1964_film)" title="Firelight (1964 film)">Firelight</a></i> (which would later inspire <i>Close Encounters</i>). The film, which had a budget of US$500, was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of $100. He also made several WWII films inspired by his father's war stories.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his parents divorced, he moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga,_California" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a> with his father. His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona, where he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" title="Passover Seder">Passover Seders</a> at the home of Zalman and Pearl Segal on an annual basis. Although he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_High_School_(Phoenix,_Arizona)" title="Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)">Arcadia High School</a> in Phoenix, Arizona for three years, Spielberg ended up graduating from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_High_School" title="Saratoga High School">Saratoga High School</a> in 1965. It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg attended synagogue as a young boy in Haddon Heights, NJ, an area which did not allow Jews before World War II. He attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_L._Lewis" title="Albert L. Lewis">Albert L. Lewis</a>, who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom's, <i>Have a Little Faith</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a child, Spielberg has faced difficulty assimilating. â€œIt isnâ€™t something I enjoy admitting,â€&#157; he once said, â€œbut when I was 7, 8, 9 years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parentsâ€™ Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times. My grandfather always wore a long black coat, black hat and long white beard. I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house, because he might be in a corner davening [praying], and I wouldnâ€™t know how to explain this to my WASP friends.â€&#157; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitic" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> prejudice in his early life: he later said, "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After moving to California, he applied to attend the film school at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> School of Theater, Film and Television three separate times, but was unsuccessful. He was a student subsequently of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Long_Beach" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a>. While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s, Spielberg became member of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Chi_Fraternity" title="Theta Chi Fraternity">Theta Chi Fraternity</a>. His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid, seven-day-a-week intern and guest of the editing department. After Spielberg became famous, USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994, and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university. In 2002, thirty-five years after starting college, Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB, and was awarded a B.A. in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film/Video Production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an intern and guest of Universal Studios, Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release, the 24 minute film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin%27" title="Amblin'">Amblin'</a></i> (1968), the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment" title="Amblin Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a>. After Sidney Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal's TV arm, saw the film, Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal). He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director. In 1969, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film, <i>Malcolm Winkler</i>, written by Claudia Salter, produced by John Orland, with Frank Price being the executive producer. However, because of the difficulty in casting the key male role, the film was not made. Steven Spielberg attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery" title="Night Gallery">Night Gallery</a></i>. The segment, "Eyes," starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby,_M.D." title="Marcus Welby, M.D.">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a></i>, Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Game_(TV_series)" title="The Name of the Game (TV series)">The Name of the Game</a></i> called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._2017" title="L.A. 2017">L.A. 2017</a>". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on <i>Night Gallery</i> and did some work for shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Marshall:_Counselor_at_Law" title="Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law">Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law</a></i> and <i>The Psychiatrist</i> before landing the first series episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(TV_series)" title="Columbo (TV series)">Columbo</a></i> (previous episodes were actually TV films).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson" title="Richard Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> adaptation called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_(1971_film)" title="Duel (1971 film)">Duel</a></i>. The film is about a psychotic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterbilt_281" title="Peterbilt 281">Peterbilt 281</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_truck" title="Tanker truck">tanker truck</a> driver who chases a terrified driver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Weaver" title="Dennis Weaver">Dennis Weaver</a>) of a small <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Valiant" title="Plymouth Valiant">Plymouth Valiant</a> and tries to run him off the road. <i>Duel</i> was his first feature film and major hit when it was released into theaters. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilys_Powell" title="Dilys Powell">Dilys Powell</a> was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Evil" title="Something Evil">Something Evil</a></i>) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)" title="The Exorcist (film)">The Exorcist</a></i>, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called <i>Savage</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>. Spielberg's debut theatrical feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i>, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> stated that "a major new director is on the horizon." However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studio producers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Zanuck" title="Richard D. Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" title="David Brown (producer)">David Brown</a> offered Spielberg the director's chair for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>, a thriller-horror film based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley" title="Peter Benchley">Peter Benchley</a> novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three <b>Academy Awards</b> (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing $470,653,000 worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania." <i>Jaws</i> made him a household name, as well as one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects. It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rejecting offers to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_2" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film)" title="King Kong (1976 film)">King Kong</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFOs</a>, which became <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, <i>Close Encounters</i> was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmos_Zsigmond" title="Vilmos Zsigmond">Vilmos Zsigmond</a>, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_(film)" title="1941 (film)">1941</a></i>, a big-budgeted World War II farce wasn't nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4Â million dollars worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics. It has since become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult classic</a> thanks to television showings and home video releases.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg then revisited his <i>Close Encounters</i> project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released <i>Close Encounters: The Special Edition</i> in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, Spielberg teamed with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> creator and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> on an action adventure film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>, the first of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> (whom Lucas had previously cast in his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>). The film was considered a homage to the cliffhanger serials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Hollywood" title="Golden Age of Hollywood">Golden Age of Hollywood</a>. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). <i>Raiders</i> is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his people and is trying to get back home. <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. <i>E.T.</i> was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)" title="Poltergeist (film)">Poltergeist</a></i> (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">The Twilight Zone</a></i> (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies" title="The Goonies">The Goonies</a></i> (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next directorial feature was the <i>Raiders</i> sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i>. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, <i>Temple of Doom</i> is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. In an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">AFI</a> interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong consistent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naÃ¯ve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (<i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film)" title="Empire of the Sun (film)">Empire of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)" title="Munich (film)">Munich</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal" title="The Terminal">The Terminal</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_(1997_film)" title="Amistad (1997 film)">Amistad</a></i>. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in <i>Jaws</i> are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in <i>Hook</i> starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in <i>E.T.</i>, is the most famous example of this theme. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i>, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" title="Oskar Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a>, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a></i> depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> is a committed family man, while John Anderton in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i> is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (early in the film another, secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and <i>Always</i>. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> as a headteacher in <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed him only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), veteran voice actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Welker" title="Frank Welker">Frank Welker</a> has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> to its sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch" title="Gremlins 2: The New Batch">Gremlins 2: The New Batch</a></i>, as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time" title="The Land Before Time">The Land Before Time</a></i> (and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>, and television shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures" title="Tiny Toon Adventures">Tiny Toons</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></i>, and SeaQuest DSV. Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, and <i>The Terminal</i>. Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on <i>Minority Report</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i>. Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in four films: <i>Transformers</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye" title="Eagle Eye">Eagle Eye</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen" title="Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></i>. Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship.

Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i> (except <i>The Color Purple</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></i>). One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, the final scene of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, and the end credits of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i> (where they ride into the sunset), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began in May 1976. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Trumbull" title="Douglas Trumbull">Douglas Trumbull</a> served as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects_supervisor" title="Visual effects supervisor">visual effects supervisor</a>, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Rambaldi" title="Carlo Rambaldi">Carlo Rambaldi</a> designed the aliens. <i>Close Encounters</i> was released in November 1977 and was a critical and financial success.

In nighttime <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muncie,_Indiana" title="Muncie, Indiana">Muncie, Indiana</a>, three-year-old Barry Guiler is awakened when his toys start operating automatically. Fascinated, he gets out of bed and runs outside, forcing his mother Jillian to chase after him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, during a nearby large-scale <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_outage" title="Power outage">power outage</a>, Indiana <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(occupation)" title="Lineman (occupation)">electrical lineman</a> Roy Neary experiences a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_encounter#Second" title="Close encounter">close encounter</a> with a UFO on a dark country road and is soon caught up in a police chase of four UFOs. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO encounter in which Barry is abducted by unseen beings, despite her attempts at securing her house. Meanwhile, Roy's increasingly erratic behavior causes Ronnie to leave him, taking their three children with her. When a despairing Roy inadvertently sees a television news program about a train wreck near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devils_Tower_National_Monument" title="Devils Tower National Monument">Devils Tower National Monument</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, he realizes the mental image plaguing him is real. Jillian sees the same broadcast, and she and Roy, as well as others with similar experiences, head toward the site.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Elsewhere in the world, the pace of UFO activity is increasing. Lacombe and Laughlin investigate a host of occurrences along with other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> experts. Witnesses report the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(music)" title="Pitch (music)">tone</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)" title="Motif (music)">musical phrase</a> in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_scale" title="Major scale">major scale</a>.

Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">United States Army</a> evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While most of the civilians who are drawn to the site are apprehended by the Army, Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site just as dozens of UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs by use of light and sound. Following this, an enormous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_ship" title="Mother ship">mother ship</a> lands at the site, returning people who had been <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction" title="Alien abduction">abducted</a> over the years, including Barry. As the communication between the humans and UFOs continue using light and sound signals, the government officials decide to include Roy in a group of people whom they have selected to be potential visitors to the mothership, and hastily prepare him. As the aliens finally emerge from the mothership, they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Curwen" title="John Curwen">Curwen</a> hand signs that correspond to the five-note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which lifts off into the night sky.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The genesis of <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> started when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg" title="Steven Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> and his father saw a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_shower" title="Meteor shower">meteor shower</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> when the director was a young boy. As a teenager, Spielberg completed the full-length science fiction film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firelight_(1964_film)" title="Firelight (1964 film)">Firelight</a></i>. Many scenes from <i>Firelight</i> would be incorporated in <i>Close Encounters</i> on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot-for-shot" title="Shot-for-shot">shot-for-shot</a> basis. In 1970 he wrote a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_story" title="Short story">short story</a> called <i>Experiences</i> about a lovers' lane in a Midwestern United States farming community and the "light show" a group of teenagers see in the night sky.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He first considered doing a documentary or a low-budget feature film about people who believed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFO</a>'s. Spielberg decided "a film that depended on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_art" title="State of the art">state of the art</a> technology couldn't be made for $2.5 million." Borrowing a phrase from the ending of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_from_Another_World" title="The Thing from Another World">The Thing from Another World</a></i>, he retitled the film <i>Watch the Skies</i>, rewriting the premise concerning <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Book" title="Project Blue Book">Project Blue Book</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(filmmaking)" title="Pitch (filmmaking)">pitching</a> the concept to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willard_Huyck" title="Willard Huyck">Willard Huyck</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Katz" title="Gloria Katz">Gloria Katz</a>.

I go, 'Steve, that's the worst idea I ever heard." Spielberg brought <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a> to write the script in December 1973 with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography" title="Principal photography">principal photography</a> to begin in late-1974. However, Spielberg started work on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> in 1974, pushing <i>Watch the Skies</i> back.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the financial and critical success of <i>Jaws</i>, Spielberg earned a vast amount of creative control from Columbia, including the right to make the film any way he wanted. Schrader turned in his script, which Spielberg called, "one of the most embarrassing screenplays ever professionally turned in to a major film studio or director. It was a terribly guilt-ridden story not about UFOs at all." Titled <i>Kingdom Come</i>, the script's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist" title="Protagonist">protagonist</a> was a 45-year-old Air Force Officer named Paul Van Owen who worked with Project Blue Book. "[His] job for the government is to ridicule and debunk flying saucers." Schrader continued. "One day he has an encounter. He goes to the government, threatening to blow the lid off to the public. Instead, he and the government spend 15 years trying to make contact." Spielberg and Schrader experienced creative differences, hiring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hill_(screenwriter)" title="John Hill (screenwriter)">John Hill</a> to rewrite. At one point the main character was a police officer. Spielberg "[found] it hard to identify with men in uniform. I wanted to have Mr. Everyday Regular Fella." Spielberg rejected the Schrader/Hill script during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production" title="Post-production">post-production</a> on <i>Jaws</i>. He reflected, "they wanted to make it like a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> adventure."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Giler" title="David Giler">David Giler</a> performed a rewrite. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Barwood" title="Hal Barwood">Hal Barwood</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Robbins_(screenwriter)" title="Matthew Robbins (screenwriter)">Matthew Robbins</a>, friends of Spielberg, suggested the plot device of a kidnapped child. Spielberg then began to write the script. The song "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Wish_upon_a_Star" title="When You Wish upon a Star">When You Wish upon a Star</a>" from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinocchio_(1940_film)" title="Pinocchio (1940 film)">Pinocchio</a></i> influenced Spielberg's writing style. "I hung my story on the mood the song created, the way it affected me personally." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Belson" title="Jerry Belson">Jerry Belson</a> and Spielberg wrote the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_script" title="Shooting script">shooting script</a> together. In the end, Spielberg was given solo writing credit. During <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-production" title="Pre-production">pre-production</a>, the title was changed from <i>Kingdom Come</i> to <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Allen_Hynek" title="J.

Spielberg was under enormous pressure to make another <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbuster_(entertainment)" title="Blockbuster (entertainment)">blockbuster</a> after <i>Jaws</i>, but he decided to make a UFO movie.

The Gobi Desert sequence was photographed at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumont_Dunes" title="Dumont Dunes">Dumont Dunes</a>, California, and the Dharmsala-India exteriors were actually filmed at the small village of Hal near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalapur" title="Khalapur">Khalapur</a> 35 miles (56Â km) outside Mumbai, India. The hangars in Alabama were six times larger than the biggest sound stage in the world. Various technical and budgetary problems occurred during filming. Spielberg called <i>Close Encounters</i> "twice as bad and twice as expensive [as <i>Jaws</i>]". Matters worsened when Columbia Pictures experienced financial difficulties. Spielberg estimated the film would cost $2.7 million to make in his original 1973 pitch to Columbia, but the final budget came to $19.4 million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Columbia studio executive John Veich remembered, "If we knew it was going to cost that much, we wouldn't have <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenlight" title="Greenlight">greenlighted</a> it because we didn't have the money." Spielberg hired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alves" title="Joe Alves">Joe Alves</a>, his collaborator on <i>Jaws</i>, as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_designer" title="Production designer">production designer</a>. In addition the 1976 Atlantic hurricane season brought tropical storms to Alabama. A large portion of the sound stage in Alabama was damaged because of a lightning strike.

He added more shots to the shooting schedule, pushing it back. One crew member said, 'Steven, if you would stop watching those fucking movies every night we would be on schedule.'" Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on <i>Jaws</i>. In her book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll_Never_Eat_Lunch_in_This_Town_Again" title="You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again">You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again</a></i>, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut. She was fired during post-production because of cocaine dependency. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.</p>

His work helped lead to advances in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_control_photography" title="Motion control photography">motion control photography</a>.

Instead of the metallic hardware look used in <i>Star Wars</i>, the emphasis was on a more luminescent look of the UFOs. Many of the model makers attempted comical objects in the UFOs. One was an oxygen mask with lights, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Muren" title="Dennis Muren">Dennis Muren</a> put an in-joke from his work on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_IV:_A_New_Hope" title="Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope">Star Wars</a></i>, using an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> toy. (The model that was the mother ship is now on display in the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Annex at Washington Dulles Airport in Chantilly, Virginia.) Since <i>Close Encounters</i> was filmed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anamorphic_format" title="Anamorphic format">anamorphically</a>, the visual effects sequences were shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/70_mm_film" title="70 mm film">70 mm film</a> to better conform with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/35_mm_film" title="35 mm film">35 mm film</a>. A test reel using <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> was used for the UFOs, but Spielberg found it would be too expensive since CGI was new technology in the 1970s. The small aliens in the final scenes were played by local girls in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama" title="Mobile, Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>. That decision was requested by Spielberg because he felt "girls move more gracefully than boys." Puppetry was attempted for the aliens, but the idea failed. However, Rambaldi successfully used puppetry to depict the larger alien that communicates with Lacombe near the end of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Close Encounters</i> is the first collaboration between film editor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kahn_(film_editor)" title="Michael Kahn (film editor)">Michael Kahn</a> and Spielberg. Their relationship continued for the rest of Spielberg's films. When Kahn and Spielberg delivered the first cut of the film, Spielberg was dissatisfied, feeling "there wasn't enough wow-ness". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick-up_(filmmaking)" title="Pick-up (filmmaking)">Pick-ups</a> were commissioned but cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond could not participate. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Alonzo" title="John A.

This was an important scene added in the re-shoots. Composer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> wrote over 300 examples of the iconic five-tone <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(music)" title="Motif (music)">motif</a> before Spielberg chose the right one. Spielberg called Williams' work as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_You_Wish_upon_a_Star" title="When You Wish upon a Star">When You Wish upon a Star</a> meets science fiction". Spielberg wanted to have "When You Wish upon a Star" in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closing_credits" title="Closing credits">closing credits</a>, but was denied permission. He also took 7.5 minutes out from the preview.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The score emphasizes and highlights the dramatic theme of the film by reflecting the spirituality of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>â€™ experience with the UFOs as well as the mystical attraction that he and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_Dillon" title="Melinda Dillon">Melinda Dillon</a> have towards the spaceship. The often impressionistic score is evocative of the peacefulness that the space travelers represent. The "spaceship communication" five tone motif has become a famous theme. The five tones are used by scientists to communicate with the visiting spaceship as a mathematical language. It became the primary focus of the scene in which the mothership communicates tonally with earth and progresses through an impressive series of developments. Although rhythmically and melodically simple, it became a dramatic device and important musical statement throughout the entire film. This score is also modernist in the sense that Williams uses <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric" title="Aleatoric">aleatoric</a> (quasi-improvised) and non-tonal processes. The most advanced music in the film occurs in the scene when the young boy is drawn away from the house to the spaceship. </p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Film critic Charlene Engel observed <i>Close Encounters</i> "suggests that humankind has reached the point where it is ready to enter the community of the cosmos. While it is a computer interface which makes the final musical conversation with the alien guests possible, the characteristics bringing Neary to make his way to Devil's Tower have little to do with technical expertise or computer literacy. These are virtues taught in schools that will be evolved in the 21st century." The film also evokes typical <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype" title="Archetype">archetypes</a> and motifs. The film portrays new technologies as a natural and expected outcome of human development and indication of health and growth.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other critics found a variety of Judeo-Christian analogies. Devil's Tower parallels <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Sinai" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a>, the aliens as God and Roy Neary as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille" title="Cecil B.

DeMille</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ten_Commandments_(1956_film)" title="The Ten Commandments (1956 film)">The Ten Commandments</a></i> is seen on television at the Neary household. Some found close relations between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah" title="Elijah">Elijah</a> and Roy; Elijah was taken into a "chariot of fire", akin to Roy going in the UFO. Climbing Devil's Tower behind Jillian and faltering, Neary exhorts Jillian to keep moving and not to look back, similar to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lot_(Bible)" title="Lot (Bible)">Lot</a>'s wife who looked back at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom</a> and turned into a pillar of salt. Spielberg explained, "I wanted to make <i>Close Encounters</i> a very accessible story about the everyday individual who has a sighting that overturns his life, and throws it in to complete upheaval as he starts to become more and more obsessed with this experience."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Roy's wife Ronnie attempts to hide the sunburn caused by Roy's exposure to the UFOs and wants him to forget his encounter with them. She is embarrassed and bewildered by what has happened to him and desperately wants her ordinary life back. The expression of his lost life is seen when he is sculpting a huge model of Devil's Tower in his living room, with his family deserting him. Roy's obsession with an idea implanted by an alien intelligence, his construction of the model, and his gradual loss of contact with his wife, mimic the events in the short story "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dulcie_and_Decorum" title="Dulcie and Decorum">Dulcie and Decorum</a>" (1955) by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Knight" title="Damon Knight">Damon Knight</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Close Encounters</i> also studies the form of "youth spiritual yearning". Barry Guiler, the unfearing child who refers to the UFOs and their paraphernalia as "Toys", serves as a motif for childlike innocence and openness in the face of the unknown. Spielberg also compared the theme of communication as highlighting that of tolerance. "If we can talk to aliens in <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>," he said, "why not with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Reds</a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>?" Sleeping is the final obstacle to overcome in the ascent of Devil's Tower. Roy, Jillian Guiler and a third invitee climb the mountain pursued by government helicopters spraying sleeping gas. The third person stops to rest, is gassed, and falls into a deep sleep.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his interview with Spielberg on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_the_Actors_Studio" title="Inside the Actors Studio">Inside the Actors Studio</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Lipton" title="James Lipton">James Lipton</a> suggested <i>Close Encounters</i> had another, more personal theme for Spielberg: "Your father was a computer engineer; your mother was a concert pianist, and when the spaceship lands, they make music together on the computer", suggesting that Roy Neary's boarding the spaceship is Spielberg's wish to be reunited with his parents. In a 2005 interview, Spielberg stated that he made <i>Close Encounters</i> when he did not have children, and if he were making it today, he would never have had Neary leave his family and go on the mother ship.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was originally to be released in summer 1977, but was pushed back to November because of the various problems during production, Upon its release, <i>Close Encounters</i> became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office" title="Box office">box office</a> success, grossing $116.39 million in North America and $171.7 million in foreign countries, totaling $288 million. It became <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>' most successful film at that time. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenbaum" title="Jonathan Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> refers to the film as "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision." A.D. Murphy of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> gave a positive review but felt "<i>Close Encounters</i> lacks the warmth and humanity of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>'s <i>Star Wars</i>". Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but was highly impressed with the climax. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> called it "a kid's film in the best sense." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Renoir" title="Jean Renoir">Jean Renoir</a> compared Spielberg's storytelling to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_M%C3%A9li%C3%A8s" title="Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s">Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Bradbury" title="Ray Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. Based on 39 reviews collected by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, 95% of the reviewers have enjoyed the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_cut_privilege" title="Final cut privilege">final cut privilege</a>, Spielberg was dissatisfied with <i>Close Encounters</i>. "Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," Spielberg explained. "Anyway, <i>Close Encounters</i> was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted to make my own <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director%27s_cut" title="Director's cut">director's cut</a>. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_ship" title="Mother ship">mother ship</a> so they could have something to hang a [reissue marketing] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." In 1979, Columbia Pictures gave Spielberg $1.5 million to produce what would become the "Special Edition" of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various scenes so that the Special Edition ended up three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Cotopaxi" title="SS Cotopaxi">SS <i>Cotopaxi</i></a> in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gobi_Desert" title="Gobi Desert">Gobi Desert</a>, and a view of the inside of the mothership. <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition</i> was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7 million, accumulating a final $303.79 million box office gross. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. This new version is quite simply a better film. Why didn't Spielberg make it this good the first time?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1998, Spielberg recut <i>Close Encounters</i> again for what would become the "Collectors Edition," to be released on home video and laserdisc. This version of the film is something of a re-edit of the original 1977 release with some elements of the 1980 Special Edition, but omits the mothership interior scenes which Spielberg felt should have remained a mystery. The laserdisc edition also includes a new 101-minute documentary, <i>The Making of Close Encounters</i>, which was produced in 1997 and features interviews with Spielberg, the main cast, and notable crew members. There have also been many other alternate versions of the film for network and syndicated television, as well as a previous laserdisc version. Some of these even combined all released material from the 1977 and 1980 versions, but none of these versions were edited by Spielberg, who regards the "Collector's Edition" as his definitive version of <i>Close Encounters</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was released on DVD in June 2001. It was released as a two-disc set that contained the "Collector's Edition". The second disc contained a wealth of extra features including the 101-minute "Making Of" documentary from 1997, a featurette from 1977, trailers, and deleted scenes that included, among other things, the mothership interiors from the 1980 Special Edition. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Berardinelli" title="James Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> felt "<i>Close Encounters</i> is still unquestionably a great movie. Its universal appeal gave movie-goers something to be excited about during 1977â€“78 as the first in a wave of post-<i>Star Wars</i> science fiction films broke. Today, the movie stands up remarkably well. The story is fresh and compelling, the special effects are as remarkable as anything that CGI can do, and the music represents some of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a>' best work." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Levy" title="Emanuel Levy">Emanuel Levy</a> also gave a highly-positive review. "Spielberg's greatest achievement is to make a warm, likable sci-fi feature, deviating in spirit, tone and ideology from the dark, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">noirish</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_movies_(Transition_in_the_1950s)" title="B movies (Transition in the 1950s)">sci-fi films that dominated the 1950s</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a> mentality. He ultimately succeeded."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Close Encounters</i> was given a second DVD release and a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc" title="Blu-ray Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> release in November 2007. Released for the film's 30th anniversary, the set contained all three major theatrical versions of the film from 1977, 1980, and 1998 and a new interview with Spielberg, who talks about the film's impact thirty years after its release. The set also includes the 1977 featurette, various trailers, and the 1997 "Making Of" documentary - though this is now split over three discs rather than as a single feature as with the 2001 DVD release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shortly after the film's release in late 1977, Spielberg desired to do either a sequel or <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prequel" title="Prequel">prequel</a>. He explained, "The army's knowledge and ensuing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cover-up" title="Cover-up">cover-up</a> is so subterranean that it would take a creative screen story, perhaps someone else making the picture and giving it the equal time it deserves."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was nominated for nine Oscars at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50th_Academy_Awards" title="50th Academy Awards">50th Academy Awards</a>, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Direction</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Supporting Actress</a> (Melinda Dillon), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Visual_Effects" title="Academy Award for Visual Effects">Visual Effects</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Art_Direction" title="Academy Award for Best Art Direction">Art Direction</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alves" title="Joe Alves">Joe Alves</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_A._Lomino" title="Daniel A.
