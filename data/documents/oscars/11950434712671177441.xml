	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film explores the experiences and interactions of the passengers and crew aboard a fictional Trans-Orient-Pacific (TOPAC) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC-4" title="DC-4">DC-4</a> commercial airline flight from Honolulu to San Francisco that develops engine problems at its mid-way point resulting in a serious fuel leak. The 17 passengers on the flight consist of single women May Holst and Sally McKee, government scientist Donald Flaherty, advertising executive Howard Rice and wife Lydia, New York theater personality Gustave Pardee and wife Lillian, TOPAC Board member Ken Childs, drug company owner Humphrey Agnew, tourists Ed Joseph and wife Clara, newlyweds Milo and Nell Buck, retiree Frank Briscoe, Korean refugee Dorothy Chen, fisherman Jose Lacota, and unaccompanied child Toby Field. The five member flight crew consists of Capt. John Sullivan, First Officer Dan Roman, Second Officer Hobie Wheeler, Navigator Lenny Wilby, and Flight Attendant Spaulding.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first half of the film takes place during the otherwise routine portion of the flight and is devoted to the extensive exposition of the passengers' and crews' individual backgrounds, current situations, various relationships, and the development of the characters of each as personalities. Just past the point of no return, however, a runaway prop causes an engine fire and fuel leak that begins hours of terror for all aboard. While the flight crew struggles with managing the situation on the airliner, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" title="United States Coast Guard">USCG</a> launches an air-sea-rescue effort from Alameda in case the airliner is forced down in the ocean.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Wayne and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Fellows" title="Robert Fellows">Robert Fellows</a> had formed Wayne-Fellows Productions in 1952, the duo worked on several films including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Jim_McLain" title="Big Jim McLain">Big Jim McLain</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plunder_of_the_Sun" title="Plunder of the Sun">Plunder of the Sun</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sky_(1953_film)" title="Island in the Sky (1953 film)">Island in the Sky</a></i>. In 1953, director William Wellman was releasing <i>Island in the Sky</i> when he learned that his screenwriter Ernest Gann was writing another aviation story. Gann shared the story with Wellman, and the director offered to make a sales pitch. Wellman relayed the story of <i>The High and the Mighty</i> to Wayne-Fellows Productions. Wayne purchased the story on the spot, agreeing to give Gann $55,000 for the story and the screenplay plus 10 percent of the film's earnings. Wayne also agreed to give Wellman 30 percent of the earnings to be the film's director, based on the condition that <i>The High and the Mighty</i> would be filmed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScope" title="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a>. It was a widescreen projection process that involved using an anamorphic lens to add a wide picture to regular 35Â mm film. Wellman's experience was that the CinemaScope camera was "bulky and unwieldy", and the director preferred to station the camera in one place. Since <i>The High and Mighty</i> was set on an airliner with cramped quarters, Wellman did not need to worry about flexibility in composing shots. He hired <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Clothier" title="William H. Clothier">William H. Clothier</a>, with whom he had worked on many films, as cinematographer. Ernest K. Gann wrote the original novels on which both films were based along with both screenplays.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The High and the Mighty</i> depicts a dramatic situation in a civil transport aviation context. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> initially was opposed to the film, believing that audiences would not stay interested in a plot stretching over 100 minutes involving passengers in a aircraft. William Wellman had reservations about the "intimate" storyline which dominate the production, preferring to focus more on aircraft and pilots, yet after script deliberations set out the final screenplay, he endorsed the novel approach that harkened back to films such as the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_(film)" title="Grand Hotel (film)">Grand Hotel</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The DC-4 (<i>N4726V</i>; ex-<i>N66694</i>, ex-<i>LV-ABR</i>) used to film the tarmac, passenger boarding (at "Gate 4"), takeoff, and daylight flying sequences was a former <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-54_Skymaster" title="C-54 Skymaster">C-54</a>A-10-DC (c/n 10315) built as a military transport in 1942 at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach,_California" title="Long Beach, California">Long Beach, California</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Aircraft_Company" title="Douglas Aircraft Company">Douglas Aircraft Company</a> under <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces" title="United States Army Air Forces">U.S. Army Air Force</a> contract (USAAF s/n 42-72210).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When the exterior and flying sequences were filmed in mid-November, 1953, the airliner was being operated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a>-based non-scheduled carrier <a href="http://www.transoceanairlines.com/" rel="nofollow">Transocean Airlines</a> (1946â€“1962), the largest <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_aviation" title="Civil aviation">civil aviation</a> operator of recycled C-54's in the 1950s. Novel and screenplay author Ernest K. Gann wrote the original book while he was flying C-54s for Transocean over the Hawaii-California routes. The airliner was named <i>The Argentine Queen</i> and had once been the personal aircraft of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Per%C3%B3n" title="Juan PerÃ³n">Juan PerÃ³n</a>, the controversial three-time President of Argentina. It was later operated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slick_Airways" title="Slick Airways">Slick Airways</a> before being acquired by Transocean in 1953. The film's fictional airline's name "TOPAC" was painted over the Transocean's red, white and yellow color scheme for filming.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transocean Airlines director of flight operations Bill Keating did the stunt flying for the movie. Keating and Gann had flown together and the author recommended his friend for the work. During preproduction filming, Keating was involved in a near-incident when simulating the climactic night emergency landing. After several approaches, Wellman asked for "one more take" touching down even closer to the runway's threshold. Keating complied, taking out runway lights with his nose landing gear before "peeling off" and executing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go-around" title="Go-around">go-around</a>. Wellman quipped that the crash would look good in another film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to this aircraft, a second Transocean C-54/DC-4 equipped with a large double cargo door used to accommodate the loading of freight on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallet" title="Pallet">pallets</a>, was employed for all shots of the damaged airliner on the ground at San Francisco in the film's closing sequences. A propellerless, fire-scorched engine on a distorted mount with a 30Âº "droop" was installed on the left wing of this aircraft to represent the damage which had emperiled the flight. Exterior airport scenes were filmed at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glendale,_California#History" title="Glendale, California">Glendale</a> <a href="http://www.godickson.com/gca1.htm" rel="nofollow">Grand Central Air Terminal</a>, east of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burbank,_California" title="Burbank, California">Burbank, California</a>, where an outdoor movie set was constructed to replicate the terminal gates at SFO in the early 1950s. Additional exteriors utilized <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_International_Airport" title="Oakland International Airport">Oakland International Airport</a> for all boarding, engine run-up, taxiing and takeoff scenes used in the opening sequences. The external night and damaged in-flight sequences were filmed in a studio where a large scale <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniature_effect" title="Miniature effect">miniature</a> was photographed against backdrops. Passenger cabin and flight deck interior scenes were all filmed on sets built on a Warner Bros. sound stage.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unlike the fictional engine fire in the film which the stricken DC-4 airliner portrayed by <i>The Argentine Queen</i> survived and reached San Francisco safely, ironically a decade after its appearance in the motion picture this same aircraft suffered a similar engine fire during an overnight trans-Pacific flight and was lost with no survivors. At 8:47 PM (HST) on March 27, 1964, <i>N4726V</i> took off on a charter flight from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honolulu" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> with a crew of three and six passengers on board. A few minutes before 6 AM (PST), eight hours into the anticipated 11 hour, 40 minute flight, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayday_(distress_signal)" title="Mayday (distress signal)">Mayday</a> call from the pilot was heard reporting the flight's position as about 700 miles west of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> with a serious fire in engine #2 (left inboard), and saying that "...we may have to put it in" (aviation jargon for ditching in the ocean). No further transmissions were heard.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The United States Coast Guard conducted a five-day search for the missing DC-4, but no traces of either the airliner or its occupants were ever found. Later investigation revealed engine #2 had a recurring oil leak in the propeller governor assembly on an earlier flight that had resulted in temporary grounding. The cause of the in flight fire remained undetermined.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming took place from November 25, 1953 to January 11, 1954 on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldwyn_Pictures" title="Goldwyn Pictures">Goldwyn Pictures</a> lot and Warners soundstages in Hollywood. Most of the cast sat in the passenger cabin for weeks during filming. Cast members recalled disliking the experience; Claire Trevor called it "a dreary picture to make". Some cast members passed the time by staying in character in between shots and doing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram" title="Cryptogram">cryptograms</a>. During cold weather, the soundstage was not properly heated, and cast members suffered from the cold. Wayne and Stack did not face similar problems since they were filmed separately and comfortably in the cockpit set. Additional filming took place in San Francisco as well as at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel" title="Royal Hawaiian Hotel">Royal Hawaiian Hotel</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki_Beach" title="Waikiki Beach">Waikiki Beach</a> in Hawaii.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At one point during filming, Wayne attempted to assert himself as director. Wellman argued publicly with him in defense of his directorial control, telling Wayne: "Look, you come back here behind the camera and do my job, and you're going to be just as ridiculous doing it as I would be going out there with that screwy voice of yours and that fairy walk and being Duke Wayne." Despite the initial issues on set, the two otherwise had a positive relationship and worked together on later films including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_of_the_Cat" title="Track of the Cat">Track of the Cat</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Alley" title="Blood Alley">Blood Alley</a></i>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Aircraft feature prominently in <i>The High and the Mighty</i>, including two unusual aviation events: the U.S. Coast Guard's short-lived use of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress_variants" title="B-17 Flying Fortress variants">B-17/PB-1G</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumbo_(air-sea_rescue)" title="Dumbo (air-sea rescue)">"Dumbo"</a> rescue aircraft along with a brief launch clip of experiments with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-1_flying_bomb" title="V-1 flying bomb">JB-2 version of the V-1</a> (an early kind of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruise_missile" title="Cruise missile">cruise missile</a>) at an atomic missile test site. The postwar use of piston engine aircraft in oceanic flights was a key element of the film which required the use of a then-modern airliner.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was initially budgeted at $1.32 million, but cost overruns led to a total cost of $1.47 million. For directing, Wellman received $100,000 as well as a portion of the profits. Wayne earned $175,000 in addition to a percentage of the film's box office receipts.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Casting for <i>The High and the Mighty</i> was problematic because there were no real "leading" roles which resulted in many of Hollywood's major stars turning down parts that did not appear to be "big" enough for them. With stars such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Stanwyck" title="Barbara Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_Lupino" title="Ida Lupino">Ida Lupino</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> rejecting parts in the film, Wellman ended up casting good but lesser-known actors in some of the roles. Spencer Tracy was offered the role of Dan Roman but turned it down because, Wellman said, that Tracy found the script "lousy" while assistant director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McLaglen" title="Andrew McLaglen">Andrew McLaglen</a> claimed that Tracy's friends told the actor he was "in for an ego-bruising ride" which led Tracy to excuse himself from the film. Without Tracy, Jack Warner threatened to remove the Warner Bros. funding unless another prominent lead could be found. Wellman convinced producer John Wayne to replace Tracy in his role. Wayne later said during and after production that he did not like his performance. McLaglen recalled, "He said, 'Well, it never had any love story,' I said 'It had the greatest love story that had ever been written.'" McLaglen and Wayne argued about Wayne's performance, but Wayne never conceded about his performance.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the other major male lead, Wayne had promised the role to his friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cummings" title="Robert Cummings">Bob Cummings</a>, who was a pilot and had Wellman's recommendation as well. The interview with Robert Stack eventually convinced Wellman that a nonpilot could effectively portray the drama of a cockpit conflict. Stanwyck's refusal was especially galling as the director had always treated her as a "pet."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The High and the Mighty</i> and <i>Island in the Sky</i> shared many of the same cast and production crew. Along with Wayne, six other actors appear in both films: Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, Carl Switzer, Ann Doran, George Chandler and Michael Wellman.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Composer Dimitri Tiomkin scored the film and composed the theme song "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_and_the_Mighty_(song)" title="The High and the Mighty (song)">The High and the Mighty</a>". The theme song was also called "The Whistling Song" because John Wayne whistled the tune during production. Tiomkin's music for the film topped <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_parade" title="Hit parade">hit parade</a> charts and remained there for weeks, increasing the profile of the film itself. A 1955 national survey of disc jockeys labeled the song as the "most whistleable tune". Hollywood producers learned that a publicized title song could have value in attracting audiences to theaters. The song's "haunting strains" were played on the radio and on recordings in the years after the film's release. It was nominated for Academy Award consideration for "Best Song".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The High and the Mighty</i> had its premiere in Hollywood at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grauman%27s_Egyptian_Theatre" title="Grauman's Egyptian Theatre">Grauman's Egyptian Theatre</a> on May 27, 1954. It was commercially released on JulyÂ 3, 1954. Although the choice of the new Cinemascope format limited theater use, it was also one of the most commercially successful films that year. Within two months of its release, it was ranked first in box-office receipts and set the record for the "fastest return of negative cost" (screen jargon for making back production costs). Over the film's run in theaters, it grossed $8.5 million in box office receipts.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of the film's release, it received mostly positive reviews. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> wrote that the film "is a class drama, blended with mass appeal into a well-rounded show that can catch on with most any audience." Edwin Schallert of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> called the film "an enormously vital picture, amazingly associated with life's panorama today, and thus filled with a rare kind of tingling excitement, especially for a modern air-minded public." Joseph Henry Jackson, writing for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Chronicle" title="San Francisco Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a></i>, said that the film has "a story that gives you no time to catch your breath".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film also received some negative reviews, with Richard Griffin of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> writing that another reviewer had criticized the cast: "All are fabricated charactersâ€”and that is the way they are played." The film's running time was also commented on by several reviewers who called it "an unbelievably long trip" and "the extreme length of its proceedings, which seems almost full flight time Honolulu-San Francisco."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modern reviews of the film are mixed. Wayne biographer Ronald L. Davis described the film, "While its plot is somewhat synthetic, the special effects and performances make for an engaging film." David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews, called the film "bloated and overlong" and that it relies on "artificial, needlessly drawn-out speeches for its characters".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">John Wayne provided a critically praised role "against type" while supporting actresses Claire Trevor and Jan Sterling earned 1954 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a> nominations for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the 1960s and 1970s, <i>The High and the Mighty</i> became a television staple, but due to tighter broadcast schedules and several royalty disputes, however, the film's last appearances on broadcast television were in 1982 on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TBS_(TV_network)" title="TBS (TV network)">TBS</a> cable channel, and on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinemax" title="Cinemax">Cinemax</a> in March/April 1985. One crucial element in <i>The High and the Mighty</i><span style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s resurrection was the extensive restoration required after decades of languishing in the Wayne film vault where the film suffered major <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_damage" title="Water damage">water damage</a> and one reel was lost for a period of time, making the possibility of such a pristine restoration seemingly unlikely. Significant portions of the film stock of <i>The High and the Mighty</i> also showed color fading which was dealt with through a restoration process. Over a year was spent on restoring the picture, and three months were spent on fixing the audio.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of the film's rarity, it developed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following" title="Cult following">cult following</a>, which led to petitions to get the film released in home video formats. The estate of John Wayne, through Gretchen Wayne, the widow of the actor's late son, Michael, made a deal in the early 2000s with Cinetech (film) and Chace Productions (sound) to update and restore both <i>The High and the Mighty</i> and another "lost" Wayne film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_in_the_Sky_(1953_film)" title="Island in the Sky (1953 film)">Island in the Sky</a></i>. This led to a distribution agreement with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batjac_Productions" title="Batjac Productions">Batjac Productions</a> (Wayne's production and distribution company) and both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_network)" title="AMC (TV network)">American Movie Classics</a> (for TV rights) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> (home video rights). Following the recovery of the lost reel, <i>The High and the Mighty</i>, after its meticulous restoration, was rebroadcast on television in July 2005, the first broadcasts in 20 years.
