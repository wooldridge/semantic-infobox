	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>The Sting</b></i> is a 1973 American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film" title="Heist film">caper film</a> set in September 1936 that involves a complicated plot by two professional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">grifters</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>) to con a mob boss (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shaw_(actor)" title="Robert Shaw (actor)">Robert Shaw</a>). The film was directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Roy_Hill" title="George Roy Hill">George Roy Hill</a>, who previously directed Newman and Redford in the western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butch_Cassidy_and_the_Sundance_Kid" title="Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Created by screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_S._Ward" title="David S. Ward">David S. Ward</a>, the story was inspired by real-life con games perpetrated by the brothers Fred and Charley Gondorff and documented by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Maurer" title="David Maurer">David Maurer</a> in his book <i>The Big Con: The Story of the Confidence Man</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The title phrase refers to the moment when a con artist finishes the "play" and takes the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_(victim)" title="Mark (victim)">mark</a>'s money. (Today the expression is mostly used in the context of law enforcement <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting_operation" title="Sting operation">sting operations</a>.) If a con game is successful, the mark does not realize he has been "taken" (cheated), at least not until the con men are long gone. The film is divided into distinct sections with old-fashioned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_card" title="Title card">title cards</a> with lettering and illustrations rendered in a style reminiscent of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Evening_Post" title="Saturday Evening Post">Saturday Evening Post</a></i>. The film is noted for its musical scoreâ€”particularly its main melody, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Entertainer_(rag)" title="The Entertainer (rag)">The Entertainer</a>", a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime" title="Ragtime">piano rag</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Joplin" title="Scott Joplin">Scott Joplin</a>, which was lightly adapted for the movie by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Hamlisch" title="Marvin Hamlisch">Marvin Hamlisch</a>. The film's success encouraged a surge of popularity and critical acclaim for Joplin's work.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Note:</i> The film is divided into seven sections, each introduced with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_card" title="Title card">title card</a> accompanied by music.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Johnny Hooker (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Redford</a>), a "grifter" (small-time con man) from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States" title="Great Depression in the United States">Depression-era</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois" title="Joliet, Illinois">Joliet, Illinois</a>, along with accomplices Luther Coleman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Earl_Jones" title="Robert Earl Jones">Robert Earl Jones</a>) and Joe Erie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kehoe" title="Jack Kehoe">Jack Kehoe</a>) manage to swipe $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting "mark" (victim). Luther announces his retirement from crime and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago, who can teach him the art of the 'big con'.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unfortunately the mark was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_racket" title="Numbers racket">numbers racket</a> courier for crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shaw_(actor)" title="Robert Shaw (actor)">Robert Shaw</a>). Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Durning" title="Charles Durning">Charles Durning</a>) confronts Hooker, demanding a cut and revealing Lonnegan's involvement. Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder Luther and Hooker flees to Chicago.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gondorff (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>), a once-great con-man now down on his luck, is initially reluctant to take on the dangerous Lonnegan. Eventually he decides to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as "the wire." A large number of con artists are recruited to simulate a betting parlor.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gondorff arranges to have Lonnegan's wallet stolen aboard the opulent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Limited" title="20th Century Limited">20th Century Limited</a> enroute from New York City, and poses as boorish Chicago bookie "Shaw." He buys his way into Lonnegan's private high-stakes <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker" title="Poker">poker</a> game on the train with the latter's own money. He taunts, goads and out-cheats Lonnegan, winning $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee "Kelly", is sent to collect the winnings (which Lonnegan, lacking his wallet, was of course unable to pay).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Kelly" pretends to seek the overthrow of his boss, Shaw, convincing Lonnegan that he has a partner in the Chicago <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union" title="Western Union">Western Union</a> office named Les Harmon, and that he can use this connection to win large sums of money in Shaw's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-track_betting" title="Off-track betting">off-track betting</a> (OTB) establishment by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Past-posting" title="Past-posting">past-posting</a>. Harmon is actually one of the lead con artists, going by the name Kid Twist. He and J.J. Singleton, another con man, successfully "borrow" an actual Western Union office for a very brief time, to help dupe Lonnegan.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Hooker spends the night with Loretta, he wakes up alone and begins walking to work. He sees Loretta coming toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind him, aiming a gun in his direction. The bullet passes Hooker and hits Loretta in the forehead, killing her instantly. It turns out that the hired killer was "<i>Loretta</i> Salino". The gloved man had been hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lonnegan brings a half-million dollars to "place" his bet on Lucky Dan to win, as per "Harmonâ€™s" telephoned instructions. As the race begins, and when Lonnegan confirms the bet with Harmon (aka Kid Twist) in person at the parlor, the latter displays shock, telling Lonnegan he was supposed to bet on the horse to "place", as it's going to finish second. Lonnegan panics, but is unable to retract his bet. Suddenly the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a> and Snyder burst in and order everyone to freeze. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back; Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get Lonnegan away from the crime scene so as to avoid greater complicationsâ€”Snyder immediately complies. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. Gondorff tells "Polk": "nice con, Hickey." Hooker and Gondorff then depart, as the rest of the players and members of the Sting strip the room of its contents before Snyder and/or Lonnegan and his men can come back to retrieve the money.</p>

	<li>Doyle Lonnegan's limp in the film, used to great effect by actor Robert Shaw, was in fact completely authentic as Shaw had slipped on a wet handball court at the Beverly Hills Hotel just a week before filming began and had split all the ligaments in his knee. He had to wear a leg brace during production which was kept hidden under the wide 1930s style trousers he wore. This incident was revealed by Julia Philips in her 1991 autobiography <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You%27ll_Never_Eat_Lunch_in_This_Town_Again" title="You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again">You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again</a></i>. She said that Shaw saved <i>The Sting</i> since no other actor would accept the part and that Paul Newman hand delivered the script to Shaw in London in order to ensure his participation. He no doubt paid the price for the extremely high salary his agent John Gaines held the producers up for since he was not nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award, the general feeling being, as Philips states in her book, that he should not have demanded that his name follow those of Newman and Redford before the film's opening title.</li>

There are some variances from the actual film soundtrack, as noted.
