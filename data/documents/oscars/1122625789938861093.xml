In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> from 1915, he worked on a variety of film-related jobs before directing a feature film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Turn_in_the_Road" title="The Turn in the Road">The Turn in the Road</a></i>, in 1919. A successful mounting of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_o%27_My_Heart_(1922_film)" title="Peg o' My Heart (1922 film)">Peg o' My Heart</a></i> in 1922 got him a long term contract with Goldwyn Studios, later to be absorbed into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>. Three years later he made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Parade" title="The Big Parade">The Big Parade</a></i>, among the most acclaimed war films of the silent era, and a tremendous commercial success. This success established him as one of MGM's top studio directors for the next decade. In 1928, Vidor received his first Oscar nomination, for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crowd" title="The Crowd">The Crowd</a></i>, widely regarded as his masterpiece and one of the greatest American silent films.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vidor's first sound film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah!_(1929_film)" title="Hallelujah! (1929 film)">Hallelujah!</a></i>, a groundbreaking film featuring an African-American cast, and in which he established the new language for sound films (which is still used today by most directors). His directorial career extended well in to the sound era and he continued making feature films until the late 1950s. Some of his better known sound films include <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stella_Dallas_(1937_film)" title="Stella Dallas (1937 film)">Stella Dallas</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Daily_Bread_(1934_film)" title="Our Daily Bread (1934 film)">Our Daily Bread</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Citadel_(film)" title="The Citadel (film)">The Citadel</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_in_the_Sun_(film)" title="Duel in the Sun (film)">Duel in the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead_(film)" title="The Fountainhead (film)">The Fountainhead</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_and_Peace_(1956_film)" title="War and Peace (1956 film)">War and Peace</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1962 he was head of the jury at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_Berlin_International_Film_Festival" title="12th Berlin International Film Festival">12th Berlin International Film Festival</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vidor entered in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_Book_of_World_Records" title="Guinness Book of World Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a> for the longest career as a film director: beginning in 1913 with <i>Hurricane in Galveston</i> and ending in 1980 with a short documentary on painting entitled <i>The Metaphor</i>. He was nominated five times for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_award" title="Academy award">Oscar</a> but never won in direct competition; he received an honorary award in 1979.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1967, Vidor researched the unsolved 1922 murder of fellow director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Desmond_Taylor" title="William Desmond Taylor">William Desmond Taylor</a> for a possible screenplay. Vidor never published or wrote of this research during his lifetime, but biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_D._Kirkpatrick" title="Sidney D. Kirkpatrick">Sidney D. Kirkpatrick</a> posthumously examined Vidor's notes. He alleged in his 1986 book <i>Cast of Killers</i> that Vidor had solved the sensational crime but kept his conclusions private to protect individuals still living at the time. The widely cited newsletter <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylorology" title="Taylorology">Taylorology</a></i> later noted over 100 factual errors in <i>Cast of Killers</i> and strongly disputes Kirkpatrick's conclusions, but credits the book with renewing popular interest in the crime.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1944, Vidor joined the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-communism" title="Anti-communism">anti-communist</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Alliance_for_the_Preservation_of_American_Ideals" title="Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals">Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Vidor published his autobiography, <i>A Tree is a Tree</i>, in 1953. This book's title is inspired by an incident early in Vidor's Hollywood career. Vidor wanted to film a movie in the locations where its story was set, a decision which would have greatly added to the film's production budget. A budget minded producer told him, "A rock is a rock. A tree is a tree. Shoot it in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_Park" title="Griffith Park">Griffith Park</a>" (a nearby public space which was frequently used for film exterior shots).</p>

Despite the melodramatic script, director King Vidor eagerly took on the film as emphasized the traditional family values and strong belief in hope that he felt was essential to a good motion picture.

A special outdoor set, rather than location shooting, was built to accommodate the Tijuana horse racing track scenes. Shooting began in mid-August 1931.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film, along with Beery's role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min_and_Bill" title="Min and Bill">Min and Bill</a></i>, transformed Beery from aging character actor to a verified star. It also made nine-year-old Jackie Cooper the first child star of the 1930s, an era noted for its numerous, popular child actors.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time the movie was released, critics criticized the film's lack of originality. For example, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> declared that "something more novel and subtle" was needed, although it also praised Beery's acting. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a>,</i> too, very much liked Beery in the film, noting that he delivered a "studied, adult" performance. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> called the film repetitive, blasted Cooper for sniveling, and accused director King Vidor of laying "on pathos with a steam-shovel." Nonetheless, <i>Time</i> praised the movie, declaring it "Utterly false and thoroughly convincing..." Many critics cited the "special chemistry" between Beery and Cooper, which led the two actors to be paired again numerous times. Cooper and Beery had no such chemistry off-screen. "He always made me feel uncomfortable," Cooper said, and declared that Beery treated him like an "unkept dog". Despite the film's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch" title="Kitsch">kitschiness</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodrama</a>, critics today still highly praise <i>The Champ</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Champ</i> has been described as an inverted <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick_flick" title="Chick flick">women's film</a>, because men are not generally depicted in the film at the top of the socio-economic ladder and because men are depicted as the primary giver of childcare. The famous final scene, in which the camera is thrust into Jackie Cooper's weeping face, has been compared to similar aggressive and intrusive camera work in classic motion pictures such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liebelei" title="Liebelei">Liebelei</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Oph%C3%BCls" title="Max OphÃ¼ls">Max OphÃ¼ls</a>, dir.; 1933) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Blossoms" title="Broken Blossoms">Broken Blossoms</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.W._Griffith" title="D.W.
