      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In regards to relationships (and the implicit questioning of his sexuality), Buono is quoted as saying "I've heard or read about actors being asked the immortal question 'Why have you never married?'

Her jealous sister Blanche (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_Gillespie" title="Gina Gillespie">Gina Gillespie</a>) watches from the wings.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present, both Blanche (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>) and Jane (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a>) are now retired from their acting careers and living in their decrepit old mansion. Blanche is crippled from the automobile accident and is usually holed up in her bedroom watching her old movies on television. Jane is a shadow of her former self, still drinking and wearing caked on make-up. She is abusive towards her sister, who now depends on her. There are not many visitors at the house, except for their cleaning woman Elvira (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Maidie_Norman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Maidie Norman (page does not exist)">Maidie Norman</a>). Elvira fears for Blancheâ€™s safety because of Janeâ€™s erratic behaviour. She even tells Blanche that her sister has been opening her mail and dumping it in the trash. Later, when Jane finds out that Blanche intends to sell the house and put her in a sanatorium, she responds by increasing her abuse. Blancheâ€™s beloved parakeet even disappears.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jane is now planning a comeback. She drives out to the local newspaper to place an ad for a pianist. While sheâ€™s out, Blanche makes an attempt to get help. She writes a note on a piece of paper and throws it out of her window. A neighbour, Mrs. Bates (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Lee" title="Anna Lee">Anna Lee</a>) is outside, but she doesnâ€™t see it. Nor can Mrs. Bates hear Blanche, because her daughter Liza (played by Bette Davisâ€™s daughter Barbara Merrill) is playing loud music. Jane arrives back at the house, and while she is talking to Mrs. Bates, she sees the note near her foot. She picks it up, and goes up to Blancheâ€™s room where she mocks her by telling her that she will never leave the house. Then she drops the note in Blancheâ€™s lap. Jane gets a response to her ad. An overweight man named Edwin Flagg (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Buono" title="Victor Buono">Victor Buono</a>) makes an appointment to see her that afternoon. Jane gives Elvira the day off and brings Blanche her lunch.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The house used for the exterior of the Hudson mansion is located at 172 South McCadden Place in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Park" title="Hancock Park">Hancock Park</a> section of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. The final scene on the beach was shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu,_California" title="Malibu, California">Malibu</a>, reportedly the same site where Aldrich filmed the final scene of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_Me_Deadly" title="Kiss Me Deadly">Kiss Me Deadly</a></i> (1955).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The small role of the neighbor's daughter was played by Davis' daughter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.D._Hyman" title="B.D. Hyman">B.D. Merrill</a> who, following in the footsteps of Crawford's daughter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Crawford" title="Christina Crawford">Christina</a>, later wrote a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoir" title="Memoir">memoir</a> that depicted her mother in a very unfavorable light.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before, during and after the film's making and release, there was heavy fighting between Davis and Crawford, which included Davis actually kicking Crawford in the head (she went for small stitches) and Crawford putting weights in her clothes for the scene of Jane's dragging Blanche (Davis got muscular backache as a result). Not even director Aldrich could stop the fighting, which escalated in the coming months. At Oscar time, Crawford was infuriated when Davis was nominated for an Oscar and she was overlooked. She contacted the Best Actress nominees who were unable to attend the ceremonies and offered to accept the award on their behalf should they win. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bancroft" title="Anne Bancroft">Anne Bancroft</a> was declared the winner for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_Worker_(film)" title="The Miracle Worker (film)">The Miracle Worker</a></i>, Crawford triumphantly pushed her way past Davis saying "Step aside!", and swept onstage to pick up the trophy. Davis later commented, "It would have meant a million more dollars to our film if I had won. Joan was thrilled I hadn't."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's success led to other projects featuring psychotic older women, directed and/or produced by Aldrich, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush..._Hush,_Sweet_Charlotte" title="Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte">Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Ever_Happened_to_Aunt_Alice%3F" title="What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?">What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was remade in 1991 as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_movie" title="Television movie">television movie</a> starring real-life sisters <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanessa_Redgrave" title="Vanessa Redgrave">Vanessa</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Redgrave" title="Lynn Redgrave">Lynn Redgrave</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie received good reviews and elicited mixed responses over the Davis/Crawford combination.

The feeble attempts that Mr. Aldrich has made to suggest the irony of two once idolized and wealthy females living in such depravity, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathos" title="Pathos">pathos</a> of their deep-seated envy having brought them to this, wash out very quickly under the flood of sheer grotesquerie."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> stated, "Although the results heavily favor Davis (and she earns the credit), it should be recognized that the plot, of necessity, allows her to run unfettered through all the stages of oncoming insanity ... Crawford gives a quiet, remarkably fine interpretation of the crippled Blanche, held in emotionally by the nature and temperament of the role."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> awarded the film four stars, calling it "Star wars, trenchantly served" and adding, "If it sometimes looks like a poisonous senior citizen show with over-the-top spoiled ham, just try to look away ... As in the best <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> movies, suspense, rather than actual mayhem, drives the film."</p>
