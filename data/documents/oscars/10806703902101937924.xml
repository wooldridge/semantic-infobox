His mother, Laura (nÃ©e Smith, 1922â€“2001), was a former model from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana" title="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>. His father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams (September 10, 1906Â â€“ October 18, 1987) was a senior executive at Ford Motorship in charge of the Midwest area.

Williams was raised in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episcopal_Church_in_the_United_States_of_America" title="Episcopal Church in the United States of America">Episcopal Church</a>, though his mother practiced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Science" title="Christian Science">Christian Science</a>. He grew up in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomfield_Hills,_Michigan" title="Bloomfield Hills, Michigan">Bloomfield Hills</a>, Michigan, where he was a student at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Country_Day_School" title="Detroit Country Day School">Detroit Country Day School</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marin_County,_California" title="Marin County, California">Marin County, California</a>, where he attended the public <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redwood_High_School_(Larkspur,_California)" title="Redwood High School (Larkspur, California)">Redwood High School</a>. Williams also attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claremont_McKenna_College" title="Claremont McKenna College">Claremont McKenna College</a> (then called Claremont Men's College) for four years. He has two half-brothers: Todd (who died August 14, 2007) and McLaurin.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Williams has described himself as a quiet child whose first imitation was of his grandmother to his mother. He did not overcome his shyness until he became involved with his high-school drama department.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1973, Williams was one of only 20 students accepted into the freshman class at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School" title="Juilliard School">Juilliard School</a>, and one of only two students to be accepted by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Houseman" title="John Houseman">John Houseman</a> into the Advanced Program at the school that year, the other being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Reeve" title="Christopher Reeve">Christopher Reeve</a>. In his dialects class, Williams had no trouble mastering all dialects quickly. Williams left Juilliard in 1976.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Television_career">Television career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After appearing in the cast of the short-lived <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Richard_Pryor_Show" title="The Richard Pryor Show">The Richard Pryor Show</a></i> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>, Williams was cast by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Marshall" title="Garry Marshall">Garry Marshall</a> as the alien Mork in the hit TV series "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Days" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a>". As Mork, Williams improvised much of his dialogue and devised plenty of rapid-fire verbal and physical comedy, speaking in a high, nasal voice. Mork's appearance was so popular with viewers that it led to a spin-off hit television sitcom, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mork_and_Mindy" title="Mork and Mindy">Mork and Mindy</a></i>, which ran from 1978 to 1982. Although playing the same character as in his appearance in <i>Happy Days</i>, the show was set in the present day, in Boulder, Colorado, instead of the late '50s in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee" title="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>. Mork was an extremely popular character, featured on posters, coloring books, lunchboxes, and other merchandise.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starting in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Williams began to reach a wider audience with his standup comedy, including three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Box_Office" title="Home Box Office">HBO</a> comedy specials, <i>Off The Wall</i> (1978), <i>An Evening with Robin Williams</i> (1982), and <i>Robin Williams: Live at the Met</i> (1986). Also in 1986, Williams reached an ever wider audience to exhibit his style at the 58th Academy Awards show.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His stand-up work has been a consistent thread through his career, as is seen by the success of his one-man show (and subsequent DVD) <i>Robin Williams Live on Broadway</i> (2002). He was voted 13th on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central" title="Comedy Central">Comedy Central</a>'s list "100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time" in 2004.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After some encouragement from his friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whoopi_Goldberg" title="Whoopi Goldberg">Whoopi Goldberg</a>, he was set to make a guest appearance in the 1991 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> episode, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Matter_of_Time_(TNG_episode)" title="A Matter of Time (TNG episode)">A Matter of Time</a>", but he had to cancel due to a scheduling conflict; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Frewer" title="Matt Frewer">Matt Frewer</a> took his place as a time-traveling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con man</a>, Professor Berlingoff Rasmussen.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Williams also appeared on an episode of the American version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Line_Is_It_Anyway%3F" title="Whose Line Is It Anyway?">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a></i> (Season 3, Episode 9: November 16, 2000). During a game of "Scenes from a Hat", the scene "What Robin Williams is thinking right now" was drawn, and Williams stated "I have a career. What the hell am I doing here?"</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cinema_career">Cinema career</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of Williams' acting career has been in film, although he has given some performances on stage as well (notably as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estragon" title="Estragon">Estragon</a> in a production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot" title="Waiting for Godot">Waiting for Godot</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Martin" title="Steve Martin">Steve Martin</a>). His performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning,_Vietnam" title="Good Morning, Vietnam">Good Morning, Vietnam</a></i> (1987) got Williams nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award</a>. Many of his roles have been comedies tinged with pathos.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His role as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(Aladdin)" title="Genie (Aladdin)">Genie</a> in the animated film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)" title="Aladdin (1992 Disney film)">Aladdin</a></i> was instrumental in establishing the importance of star power in voice actor casting. Williams also used his voice talents in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FernGully:_The_Last_Rainforest" title="FernGully: The Last Rainforest">Fern Gully</a></i>, as the holographic Dr. Know in the 2001 feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>, the 2005 animated feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_(film)" title="Robots (film)">Robots</a></i>, the 2006 Academy Award winning <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Feet" title="Happy Feet">Happy Feet</a></i>, and an uncredited vocal performance in 2006's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyone%27s_Hero" title="Everyone's Hero">Everyone's Hero</a></i>. Furthermore, he was the voice of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Timekeeper" title="The Timekeeper">The Timekeeper</a>, a former attraction at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_World" title="Walt Disney World">Walt Disney World</a> Resort about a time-traveling robot who encounters <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules_Verne" title="Jules Verne">Jules Verne</a> and brings him to the future.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1998, he won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Oscar</a> as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Best Supporting Actor</a> for his role as a psychologist in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Will_Hunting" title="Good Will Hunting">Good Will Hunting</a></i>. However, by the early 2000s, he was thought by some to be typecast in films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_Adams_(film)" title="Patch Adams (film)">Patch Adams</a></i> (1998) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_(film)" title="Bicentennial Man (film)">Bicentennial Man</a></i> (1999) that critics complained were excessively <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Maudlin" title="wiktionary:Maudlin">maudlin</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Williams has also starred in dramatic films, which earned him two subsequent Academy Award nominations: First for playing an English teacher in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society" title="Dead Poets Society">Dead Poets Society</a></i> (1989), and later for playing a troubled homeless man in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fisher_King_(film)" title="The Fisher King (film)">The Fisher King</a></i> (1991); that same year, he played an adult <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a> in the movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)">Hook</a></i>.

In the 2002 dramatic thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia_(2002_film)" title="Insomnia (2002 film)">Insomnia</a></i>, Williams portrays a writer/killer on the run from a sleep-deprived Los Angeles policeman (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Pacino" title="Al Pacino">Al Pacino</a>) in rural Alaska. And also in 2002, in the psychological thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Hour_Photo" title="One Hour Photo">One Hour Photo</a></i>, Williams played an emotionally disturbed photo development technician who becomes obsessed with a family for whom he has developed pictures for a long time. In 2006 Williams starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Listener_(film)" title="The Night Listener (film)">The Night Listener</a></i>, a thriller about a radio show host who realizes he has developed a friendship with a child who may or may not exist.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He is known for his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisational_comedy" title="Improvisational comedy">improvisational</a> skills and impersonations. His performances frequently involve impromptu humor designed and delivered in rapid-fire succession while on stage. According to the <i>Aladdin</i> DVD commentary, most of his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogue" title="Dialogue">dialogue</a> as the Genie was improvised.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, he starred in five movies including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_of_the_Year_(2006_film)" title="Man of the Year (2006 film)">Man of the Year</a></i> and was the Surprise Guest at the 2006 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickelodeon_Kids%27_Choice_Awards" title="Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards">Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At one point, he was in the running to play the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddler" title="Riddler">Riddler</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Forever" title="Batman Forever">Batman Forever</a></i> until director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Burton" title="Tim Burton">Tim Burton</a> dropped the project. Earlier, Williams had been a strong contender to play the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_(comics)" title="Joker (comics)">Joker</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(1989_film)" title="Batman (1989 film)">Batman</a></i>. He had expressed interest in assuming the role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Knight_(film)" title="The Dark Knight (film)">The Dark Knight</a></i>, the sequel to 2005's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Begins" title="Batman Begins">Batman Begins</a></i>, although the part of the Joker was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledger" title="Heath Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>, who went on to win, posthumously, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Diamantopoulos" title="Chris Diamantopoulos">Chris Diamantopoulos</a> in the made-for-TV <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopic" title="Biopic">biopic</a> <i>Behind the Camera: The Unauthorized Story of Mork &amp; Mindy</i> (2005), documenting the actor's arrival in Hollywood as a struggling comedian.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In gratitude for his success with the Disney/Touchstone film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Morning,_Vietnam" title="Good Morning, Vietnam">Good Morning, Vietnam</a></i>, Robin Williams voiced the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(Aladdin)" title="Genie (Aladdin)">Genie</a> in the Disney animated film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)" title="Aladdin (1992 Disney film)">Aladdin</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">SAG</a> scale pay ($75,000), on condition that his name or image not be used for marketing, and his (supporting) character not take more than 25% of space on advertising artwork, since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toys_(film)" title="Toys (film)">Toys</a></i> was scheduled for release one month after <i>Aladdin</i>'s debut. The studio went back on the deal on both counts, especially in poster art by having the Genie in 25% of the image, but having other major and supporting characters portrayed considerably smaller. Disney's Hyperion book, <i>Aladdin: The Making Of An Animated Film</i>, listed both of Williams' characters "The Peddler" and "The Genie" ahead of main characters, but was forced to refer to him only as "the actor signed to play the Genie".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Williams and Disney had a bitter falling-out, and as a result <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Castellaneta" title="Dan Castellaneta">Dan Castellaneta</a> voiced the Genie in <i>The Return of Jafar</i>, the <i>Aladdin</i> animated television series, and had recorded his voice for <i>Aladdin and the King of Thieves.</i> When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Katzenberg" title="Jeffrey Katzenberg">Jeffrey Katzenberg</a> was fired from Disney and replaced by former <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">20th Century Fox</a> production head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Roth" title="Joe Roth">Joe Roth</a> (whose last act for Fox was greenlighting Williams' film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Doubtfire" title="Mrs. Doubtfire">Mrs. Doubtfire</a></i>), Roth arranged for a public apology to Williams by Disney. Williams agreed to perform in Hollywood Pictures' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_(film)" title="Jack (film)">Jack</a></i>, directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_Coppola" title="Francis Ford Coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a>, and even agreed to voice the Genie again for the <i>King Of Thieves</i> sequel (for considerably more than scale), replacing all of Castellaneta's dialogue.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Williams re-teamed with <i>Doubtfire</i> director Chris Columbus for 1999's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicentennial_Man_(film)" title="Bicentennial Man (film)">Bicentennial Man</a></i>, Disney asked that the budget be cut by approximately $20Â million, and when the film was released on Christmas Day, it flopped at the box office. Williams blamed Disney's marketing and the loss of content the film had suffered due to the budget cuts. As a result, Williams was again on bad terms with Disney, and Castellaneta was once again recruited to replace him as Genie in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hearts_(series)" title="Kingdom Hearts (series)">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> video game series and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney%27s_House_of_Mouse" title="Disney's House of Mouse">House of Mouse</a></i> TV series.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robin Williams has done a number of stand-up comedy tours since the early 1970s. Some of his most notable tours include <i>An Evening With Robin Williams</i> (1982), <i>Robin Williams: At The Met</i> (1986) and <i>Robin Williams LIVE on Broadway</i> (2002). The latter broke many long-held records for a comedy show. In some cases, tickets were sold out within thirty minutes of going on sale.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a six-year break, in August 2008 Williams announced a brand new 26-city tour titled "Weapons of Self Destruction". He was quoted as saying that this was his last chance to make cracks at the expense of the current Bush Administration, but by the time the show was staged only a few minutes covered that subject. The tour started at the end of September 2009, finishing in New York on December 3, and was the subject of an HBO special on December 8, 2009.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Williams was accused of stealing material from other comics to the extent that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brenner" title="David Brenner">David Brenner</a> claims that he confronted Williams personally and threatened him with bodily harm if he heard Williams utter another one of his jokes.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Robin Williams' first marriage was to Valerie Velardi on June 4, 1978, with whom he has one child, Zachary Pym (Zak) (born April 11, 1983). During Williams' first marriage, he was involved in an extramarital relationship with Michelle Tish Carter, a cocktail waitress whom he met in 1984. She sued him in 1986, claiming that he did not tell her he was infected with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpes_simplex" title="Herpes simplex">herpes simplex</a> virus before he embarked on a sexual relationship with her in the mid-1980s, during which, she said, he transmitted the virus to her. The case was settled out of court.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On April 30, 1989, he married Marsha Garces, his son's nanny who was already several months pregnant with his child. They have two children, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda_Williams" title="Zelda Williams">Zelda Rae</a> (born July 31, 1989) and Cody Alan (born November 25, 1991). However, in March 2008, Garces filed for divorce from Williams, citing irreconcilable differences.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Williams had an addiction to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a>; he has since quit.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On August 9, 2006, Williams checked himself in to a substance-abuse rehabilitation center (located in Newberg, Oregon), later admitting that he was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic" title="Alcoholic">alcoholic</a>. His publicist delivered the announcement:</p>

A simpleminded knight named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival" title="Percival">Percival</a>, referred to in the movie as "The Fool", healed the wounds with kindness to the king, asking him why he suffers and giving him a cup of water to drink. The king realizes the cup is the grail and is baffled that the boy found it, as demonstrated in the closing exchange: "I've sent my brightest and bravest men to search for this. How did <i>you</i> find it?" The Fool laughed and said "I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty." Echoes of the legend recur throughout the film, but in a continually shifting manner, so that it sometimes appears that Lucas is Percival to Parry's Fisher King, sometimes vice versa, and sometimes that one or the other is re-enacting part of the story with another character (most obviously in Parry's self-assigned quest to obtain the Grail from the man he believes is its guardian).</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack promises to find the Grail for Parry. He infiltrates the Upper West Side castle of a famous architect and retrieves the "Grail", a simple trophy. When he brings it to Parry, the catatonia is broken and Parry regains consciousness. While he and Jack lead the patients of the mental ward in a rousing rendition of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_About_You%3F" title="How About You?">How About You?</a>", Parry is reunited with Lydia and Jack (who had earlier broken up with Anne for dubious reasons) reunites with his love as well.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A central theme of the film, playing on the grail motif, is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_grace" title="Divine grace">grace</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgiveness" title="Forgiveness">forgiveness</a>. For example, Jack's signature line in his potential sitcom is "forgive me," which after the shooting becomes a tormenting echo of his arrogance when he hears it repeated by the actor who took his place in the sitcom. Parry is seeking the Holy Grail, which held the wine of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Supper" title="The Last Supper">the Last Supper</a> and, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a>, its theological equivalent, the blood of Christ - the physical counterpart of grace and forgiveness in Christian iconology. The Red Knight figment that Parry sees around New York represents his memories of the night his wife was killed; the dangling red drapes of the Red Knight's costume imitate the spray from the shot hitting his wife, and the flames recall the gun blast. In Wolfram Von Eschenbach's epic Parsival, the Red Knight was killed by Parsival (Parry) who then took his armor for himself. When Parsival introduces himself to King Arthur's court, Arthur names Parsival the new Red Knight.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Gilliam's episode of <i>The Directors</i> (which is available on the 2-Disc DVD for Gilliam's film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Bandits" title="Time Bandits">Time Bandits</a></i>), he wanted to do the film because he was tired of doing big budget special effects films, such as his previous film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Baron_Munchausen" title="The Adventures of Baron Munchausen">The Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a></i>, which went over budget and cost over $45 million, nearly twice as much as <i>King'</i>s budget of $24 million.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also, according to the <i>Directors</i> episode, Gilliam came up with the scene where Robin Williams and Amanda Plummer meet during a huge waltz in the middle of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal" title="Grand Central Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a>, because he felt the scene LaGravenese had written (which had a large group of people in a crowded subway listen to a homeless black woman sing with a beautiful voice) wasn't working. He was at first hesitant about this because his original intentions were to just shoot the script and that the waltz would make it "a Terry Gilliam film." The scene was shot in one night with some professional extras and others just passengers getting off the train.</p>
