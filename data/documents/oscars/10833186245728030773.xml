	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story of Harvey Milk, and his struggles as an American gay activist who fought for gay rights and became California's first openly gay elected official. <i>Milk</i> opens with archival footage of police raiding <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bar" title="Gay bar">gay bars</a> and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianne_Feinstein" title="Dianne Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a>'s November 27, 1978, announcement to the press that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscone%E2%80%93Milk_assassinations" title="Mosconeâ€“Milk assassinations">Milk and Moscone have been assassinated</a>. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eureka_Valley,_San_Francisco,_California" title="Eureka Valley, San Francisco, California">Eureka Valley</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_class" title="Working class">working class</a> neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_village" title="Gay village">gay neighborhood</a> known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castro,_San_Francisco,_California" title="The Castro, San Francisco, California">The Castro</a>.

Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but his frustration grows with Milk's devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_Assembly" title="California State Assembly">California State Assembly</a>, Milk finally wins a seat on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors" title="San Francisco Board of Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a> in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and in the top three in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="Conservatism in the United States">conservative</a>, has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Milk and White forge a complex working relationship.

When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briggs_Initiative" title="Briggs Initiative">Proposition 6</a>, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initiative" title="Initiative">initiative</a> on the California state ballot in November 1978.

He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for re-appointment.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filmmakers researched San Francisco's history in the city's Gay and Lesbian Archives and talked to people who knew Milk to shape their approach to the era. They also revisited the location of Milk's camera shop on Castro Street and dressed the street to match the film's 1970s setting. The camera shop, which had become a gift shop, was bought out by filmmakers for a couple of months to use in production. Production on Castro Street also revitalized the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castro_Theatre" title="Castro Theatre">Castro Theatre</a>, whose facade was repainted and whose neon marquee was redone.

The studio hoped to stay above the politics of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_general_elections,_2008" title="United States general elections, 2008">ongoing general elections</a>, especially California's anti-gay-marriage <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_8_(2008)" title="California Proposition 8 (2008)">Proposition 8</a>, which parallels the anti-gay rights Proposition 6 that is explored in the film.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Milk</i> received widespread acclaim from film critics. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported that 94% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on a sample of 209, with an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_mean" title="Weighted mean">average</a> score of 8.0/10.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Todd McCarthy of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> called the film "adroitly and tenderly observed," "smartly handled," and "most notable for the surprising and entirely winning performance by Sean Penn." He added, "while <i>Milk</i> is unquestionably marked by many mandatory scenes . . . the quality of the writing, acting and directing generally invests them with the feel of real life and credible personal interchange, rather than of scripted stops along the way from aspiration to triumph to tragedy. And on a project whose greatest danger lay in its potential to come across as agenda-driven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agitprop" title="Agitprop">agitprop</a>, the filmmakers have crucially infused the story with qualities in very short supply todayÂ â€” gentleness and a humane embrace of all its characters."</p>

Black's screenplay is based solely on his own original research and interviews, and it shows: The film is richly flavored with anecdotal incidents and details. <i>Milk</i> surfaces in a season filled with movies based on real lives, but this is the first one that inspires a sense of intimacy with its subjects."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._O._Scott" title="A. O. Scott">A. O. Scott</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> called <i>Milk</i>, "A Marvel", and wrote the film "is a fascinating, multi-layered history lesson. In its scale and visual variety it feels almost like a calmed-down <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Stone" title="Oliver Stone">Oliver Stone</a> movie, stripped of hyperbole and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oedipus" title="Oedipus">Oedipal</a> melodrama.

It stated that "<i>Milk</i> achieves what it sets out to do, telling an inspiring tale of one man's quest to legitimize his identity, to give hope to his community. I'm not sure how well it'll play outside of big cities, or if it will sway any opinions on hot-button political issues, but it gives a valiant, empathetic go of it." It also stated that the portrayal of Dan White was very fair and humanized and portrayed as more of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragic_flaw" title="Tragic flaw">tragically flawed</a> character, rather than a "typical 'crazy Christian villain' stereotype".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Podhoretz" title="John Podhoretz">John Podhoretz</a> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative" title="Conservative">conservative</a> magazine <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Standard" title="Weekly Standard">Weekly Standard</a></i> blasted the portrayal of Harvey Milk, saying that it treated the "smart, aggressive, purposefully offensive, press-savvy" activist like a "teddy bear".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Screenwriter and journalist Richard David Boyle, who described himself as a former political ally of Milk's, stated that the film made a creditable effort of recreating the era. He also wrote that Penn captured Milk's "smile and humanity", and his sense of humor about his homosexuality. Boyle reserved criticism for what he felt was the film's inability to tell the whole story of Milk's election and demise.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Davies" title="Luke Davies">Luke Davies</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monthly" title="The Monthly">The Monthly</a></i> applauded the film for recreating "the atmosphere, the sense of hope and battle; even the sound design, bustling with street noise, adds much vibrancy to the tale," but voiced criticisms in regard to the message of the film, stating "while the film is a political narrative in a grand historical sense, the murder of Milk is neither a political assassination nor an act of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia" title="Homophobia">homophobic</a> rage. Rather, it is an act of revenge for perceived wrongs and public humiliation," Davies continues to postulate that "It seems as likely that Milk would have been murdered were he heterosexual. So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it needs to be in order to hold us and take our breath away. It's a simpler story, about a man who fought an extraordinary political fight and who was killed, arbitrarily and unnecessarily." Although Davies found Penn's portrayal of Milk moving, he adds that "on a minor but troubling note, there are times when Penn's version of 'gay' acting veers dangerously close to a twee version of his childlike (read: 'mentally retarded') acting in I Am Sam." All his criticisms aside, Davies concludes that "the heart of the filmÂ â€” and while it is not perfect, it is upliftingÂ â€” lies in Penn's portrayal of Milk's generosity of spirit.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advocate" title="The Advocate">The Advocate</a></i>, while supporting the film in general, criticized the choice of Penn given the actor's support for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Cuba" title="Government of Cuba">Cuban government</a> despite the country's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Cuba" title="LGBT rights in Cuba">anti-gay rights record</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Foundation" title="Human Rights Foundation">Human Rights Foundation</a> president Thor Halvorssen said in the article "that Sean Penn would be honored by anyone, let alone the gay community, for having stood by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator" title="Dictator">dictator</a> that put gays into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_camp" title="Concentration camp">concentration camps</a> is mind-boggling." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_critic" title="Film critic">film critic</a> Patrick Goldstein commented in response to the controversy, "I'm not holding my breath that anyone will be holding Penn's feet to the fire."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film appeared on many critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2008.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late March 2009, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa" title="Samoa">Samoa</a>'s Censorship Board banned the film from distribution, without giving a reason. Samoan human rights activist Ken Moala disputed the ban, commenting that "It's really harmless, I don't know how it would affect Samoan lifestyle. It is totally different and not applicable to here, it is pretty tame really." The Pacific Freedom Forum issued a press release stating that "Samoa is the only nation worldwide where censors have specifically banned the multi-academy award winning film," limiting Samoans to smuggled or pirated versions. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa" title="American Samoa">American Samoan</a> Monica Miller, the Forum's co-chair, stated, "Observers are left to wonder at the censorship standards being applied in a country where <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa%27afafine" title="Fa'afafine">fa'afafine</a> have a well established and respected role." Fa'afafine are biologically men raised to assume female <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_role" title="Gender role">gender roles</a>, making them a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_gender" title="Third gender">third gender</a> well accepted in Samoan society. The Fa'afafine Association also criticised the ban, describing it as a "reject[ion of] the idea of homosexuality".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On April 30, Principal Censor Leiataua Niuapu released the reason for the ban, saying the film had been deemed "inappropriate and contradictory to Christian beliefs and Samoan culture": "In the movie itself it is trying to promote the human rights of gays. Some of the scenes are very inappropriate in regard to some of the sex in the film itself, it's very contrary to the way of life here in Samoa." Samoan society is, in the words of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>, "deeply conservative and devoutly Christian".</p>
