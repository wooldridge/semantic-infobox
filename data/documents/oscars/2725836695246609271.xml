      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Burton Stephen "Burt" Lancaster</b> (November 2, 1913 â€“ October 20, 1994) was an American film actor noted for his athletic physique, distinctive smile (which he called "The Grin") and, later, his willingness to play roles that went against his initial "tough guy" image. Initially dismissed as "Mr Muscles and Teeth." in the late 1950s Lancaster abandoned his "all-American" image and gradually came to be regarded as one of the best actors of his generation.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was nominated four times for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a> and won once, for his work in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry_(film)" title="Elmer Gantry (film)">Elmer Gantry</a></i> in 1960. He also won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> for that performance, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAFTA_Award" title="BAFTA Award">BAFTA Awards</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdman_of_Alcatraz_(film)" title="Birdman of Alcatraz (film)">The Birdman of Alcatraz</a></i> (1962) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City_(1980_film)" title="Atlantic City (1980 film)">Atlantic City</a></i> (1980). His production company, Hecht-Hill-Lancaster, was the most successful and innovative star-driven independent production company in 1950s Hollywood, making movies such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty" title="Marty">Marty</a></i> (1955), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapeze_(film)" title="Trapeze (film)">Trapeze</a></i> (1956), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Smell_of_Success" title="Sweet Smell of Success">Sweet Smell of Success</a></i> (1957).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster also ventured in directing, with two films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentuckian" title="The Kentuckian">The Kentuckian</a></i> (1955) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> (1974).</p>

Lancaster was the son of Elizabeth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Roberts) and James Henry Lancaster, who was a postman. Both of his parents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestantism" title="Protestantism">Protestants</a> of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working-class" title="Working-class">working-class</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a> origin, with Lancaster's grandparents having been immigrants to the U.S. from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belfast" title="Belfast">Belfast</a> and descendants of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a> immigrants to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a>. Lancaster's family believed themselves to be related to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Roberts,_1st_Earl_Roberts" title="Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts">Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts</a>; their surname originates from 11th century <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a> immigrants to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a> with the surname "de Lancastre". Lancaster grew up in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Harlem" title="East Harlem">East Harlem</a> and spent much of his time on the streets, where he developed great interest and skill in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics" title="Gymnastics">gymnastics</a> while attending the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeWitt_Clinton_High_School" title="DeWitt Clinton High School">DeWitt Clinton High School</a>. Before he graduated from DeWitt Clinton, where he was a basketball star, his mother died of a cerebral hemorrhage. Lancaster was accepted into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_University" title="New York University">New York University</a> with an athletics scholarship, but subsequently dropped out to focus on his first career choice.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Circus_career_and_military">Circus career and military</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of 9, Lancaster met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cravat" title="Nick Cravat">Nick Cravat</a>, with whom he continued to work throughout his life. Together they learned to act in local theater productions and also circus arts at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Settlement_Association" title="Union Settlement Association">Union Settlement</a>, one of the city's oldest settlement houses. They formed the acrobat duo "Lang and Cravat" and soon joined the Kay Brothers circus. However in 1939, an injury would force Lancaster to give up the profession, with great despair. (He would later be reunited with Cravat in nine films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flame_and_the_Arrow" title="The Flame and the Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Pirate" title="The Crimson Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Silent_Run_Deep" title="Run Silent Run Deep">Run Silent Run Deep</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scalphunters" title="The Scalphunters">The Scalphunters</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport_(1970_film)" title="Airport (1970 film)">Airport</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valdez_Is_Coming" title="Valdez Is Coming">Valdez Is Coming</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulzana%27s_Raid" title="Ulzana's Raid">Ulzana's Raid</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Island_of_Dr._Moreau_(1977_film)" title="The Island of Dr. Moreau (1977 film)">The Island of Dr. Moreau</a></i>.) He then found temporary work, first as a salesman for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Fields" title="Marshall Fields">Marshall Fields</a>, and then as a singing waiter in various restaurants, until 1942.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Though initially unenthusiastic about acting, he returned from service, auditioned for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> play and was offered a role. Although <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Brown_(writer)" title="Harry Brown (writer)">Harry Brown</a>'s <i>A Sound of Hunting</i> was not successful, Lancaster's performance drew the attention of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> agent, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hecht" title="Harold Hecht">Harold Hecht</a>, who introduced him to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Wallis" title="Hal Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> who cast Lancaster in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1946_film)" title="The Killers (1946 film)">The Killers</a></i> (1946). (Hecht and Lancaster later formed several production companies in the 50's to give Lancaster greater creative control.) The tall, muscular actor won significant acclaim and appeared in two more films the following year. Subsequently, he played in a variety of films, especially in dramas, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thrillers</a>, and military and adventure films. In two, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flame_and_the_Arrow" title="The Flame and the Arrow">The Flame and the Arrow</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Pirate" title="The Crimson Pirate">The Crimson Pirate</a>,</i> a friend from his circus years, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cravat" title="Nick Cravat">Nick Cravat</a>, played a key supporting role, and both actors impressed audiences with their acrobatic prowess.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, Lancaster played one of his best remembered roles with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity" title="From Here to Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a>.</i> The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which he and Deborah Kerr make love on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii" title="Hawaii">Hawaiian</a> beach amid the crashing waves. The organization named it one of "AFI's top 100 Most Romantic Films" of all time. In the mid-1950s, Lancaster went on challenging himself with varied cinematic roles, and he satisfied longtime aspirations by forming a film production partnership, Hecht-Lancaster Productions (eventually <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Hecht" title="Harold Hecht">Hecht</a>-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hill_(film_producer)" title="James Hill (film producer)">Hill</a>-Lancaster Productions) as well, having a pioneering role in the development of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_cinema" title="Independent cinema">independent cinema</a>. His work was recognized in 1960 when he won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award" title="Golden Globe Award">Golden Globe Award</a>, and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Award" title="New York Film Critics Award">New York Film Critics Award</a> for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Gantry_(film)" title="Elmer Gantry (film)">Elmer Gantry</a>.</i> In 1968, at the age of 52, Lancaster appeared nude in director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Perry" title="Frank Perry">Frank Perry</a>'s film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Swimmer_(film)" title="The Swimmer (film)">The Swimmer</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster made several films over the years with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Walk_Alone" title="I Walk Alone">I Walk Alone</a></i> (1948), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfight_at_the_OK_Corral_(1957_film)" title="Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957 film)">Gunfight at the OK Corral</a></i> (1957), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil%27s_Disciple_(1959_film)" title="The Devil's Disciple (1959 film)">The Devil's Disciple</a></i> (1959), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Days_in_May" title="Seven Days in May">Seven Days in May</a></i> (1964), which fixed the notion of the pair as something of a team in the public imagination. The notion was firmly cemented by the time Lancaster and Douglas reteamed for their final movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tough_Guys" title="Tough Guys">Tough Guys</a></i> (1986). Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these films, but with the exception of <i>I Walk Alone,</i> in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were usually more or less the same size.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the later part of his career, Lancaster left adventure and acrobatic movies behind and portrayed more distinguished characters. This period brought him work on several European productions, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">directors</a> such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luchino_Visconti" title="Luchino Visconti">Luchino Visconti</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernardo_Bertolucci" title="Bernardo Bertolucci">Bernardo Bertolucci</a>. Lancaster sought demanding roles and, if he liked a part or a director, was prepared to work for much lower pay than he might have earned elsewhere; he even helped to finance movies whose artistic value he believed in. He also mentored directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Pollack" title="Sydney Pollack">Sydney Pollack</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frankenheimer" title="John Frankenheimer">John Frankenheimer</a> and appeared in several TV films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Lancaster has a star on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> at 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was an early and successful actor/producer. He formed his own production company, Hecht-Lancaster (later Hecht-Hill-Lancaster), and directed two films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kentuckian" title="The Kentuckian">The Kentuckian</a></i> in 1955 and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Man_(1974_film)" title="The Midnight Man (1974 film)">The Midnight Man</a></i> in 1974.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster vigorously guarded his private life. He was married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce â€” to June Ernst from 1935 to 1946 and to Norma Anderson from 1946 to 1969. His third marriage, to Susan Martin, was from September 1990 until his death in 1994. All five of his children were with Norma Anderson: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Lancaster" title="Bill Lancaster">Bill</a> (who became a screenwriter), James, Susan, Joanna, and Sighle (pronounced Sheila). He claims he was romantically involved with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a> during the filming of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity" title="From Here to Eternity">From Here to Eternity</a></i> in 1953. However Ms. Kerr had stated that while there was a spark of attraction, nothing ever happened. He also had an affair with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Blondell" title="Joan Blondell">Joan Blondell</a>. In her 1980 autobiography, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Winters" title="Shelley Winters">Shelley Winters</a> claimed to have had a long affair with him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lancaster was a vocal supporter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" title="Liberalism">liberal</a> political causes, and frequently spoke out with support for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_minorities" title="Racial minorities">racial minorities</a>. He was also instrumental in the formation of many liberal groups, through financial support. At one point, he was rumored to be a member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA" title="Communist Party USA">Communist Party</a>, because of his involvement in many liberal causes. He was a vocal opponent of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam War</a> and political movements such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, and he helped pay for the successful defense of a soldier accused of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragging" title="Fragging">fragging</a>" (murdering) another soldier during the war.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a>) is transferred from the Bugle Corps at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Shafter" title="Fort Shafter">Fort Shafter</a> to a rifle outfit, Company "G," at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schofield_Barracks" title="Schofield Barracks">Schofield Barracks</a> on the island of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oahu" title="Oahu">Oahu</a>. When Captain Dana "Dynamite" Holmes (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Ober" title="Philip Ober">Philip Ober</a>) learns of his reputation as a talented boxer, he recommends that Prewitt join the regimental boxing club that he heads, and promises that Prewitt will be promoted to corporal or even sergeant, if he helps win the boxing trophy on December 15. Prewitt refuses, explaining that after permanently blinding a man in a sparring match, he swore he would never take up boxing again. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Sergeant" title="First Sergeant">First Sergeant</a> Milton Warden (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster" title="Burt Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a>) suggests that he try to get Prewitt to change his mind by making life as difficult as possible. He gets the other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officers</a> to help. Prewitt is supported only by his friend, Private Angelo Maggio (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Behind his commander's back, Warden begins an affair with Holmes' neglected wife Karen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a>). Sergeant Maylon Stark tells Warden of Karen's many affairs at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Bliss" title="Fort Bliss">Fort Bliss</a>, including his own. As their relationship develops, Karen asks Warden to apply for officer training, so she can divorce Holmes and marry him. When he finally admits that he does not want to be an officer, she sadly ends the affair.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Matters come to a head when Sergeant Galovitch picks a fight with Prewitt while on yard detail. The two soon come to blows. At first, Galovitch repeatedly pummels Prewitt, who refuses to fight back and blocks some of the blows. But as Galovitch and others watching continue taunting him, he begins boxing and nearly beats Galovitch before Holmes finally steps in and stops the fight. When Galovitch falsely accuses Prewitt of insubordination, Holmes is about to punish Prewitt again until the man in charge of the detail says that it was Galovitch, not Prewitt, who was spoiling for the fight. Instead of punishing Galovitch, Holmes abruptly lets him off the hook and disperses the crowd. The entire incident is witnessed by the base commander, who orders an investigation by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_General" title="Inspector General">Inspector General</a>. When Holmes' true intentions are revealed, the general orders a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court-martial" title="Court-martial">court-martial</a>. When Holmes begs for an alternative, the commanding officer's aide suggests that Holmes resign his commission "for the good of the service" and leave the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Army" title="US Army">Army</a>, which the general accepts with dispatch. Holmes' replacement, Captain Ross, orders that Sergeant Galovitch be demoted to private and put in charge of the latrine.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, defending his sister's honor, Maggio gets into a bar-room brawl with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_Sergeant" title="Staff Sergeant">Staff Sergeant</a> James R. "Fatso" Judson (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Borgnine" title="Ernest Borgnine">Ernest Borgnine</a>), whom he strikes with a stool. Judson then pulls out a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switchblade" title="Switchblade">switchblade</a> on Maggio, but the fight is soon broken up by Warden. When the undisciplined Maggio walks off guard duty and goes <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWOL" title="AWOL">AWOL</a>, he is arrested and sentenced to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockade" title="Stockade">stockade</a>, under Judson's charge. Judson takes advantage of the opportunity to brutally beat and torture the defiant Maggio repeatedly. Maggio manages to escape and find Prewitt. He tells of the abuse he endured before dying in Prewitt's arms. The next night, Prewitt plays taps as tears stream down his cheeks. Seeking revenge, Prewitt tracks down Judson and pretends to have a talk with him in a back alley, but instead threatens Judson. The two fight with switchblades, Prewitt using the very same switchblade Judson pulled on Maggio. Prewitt kills Judson, but not before sustaining a serious stomach wound.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He goes into hiding in the apartment of his girlfriend Lorene (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Reed" title="Donna Reed">Donna Reed</a>), a nightclub hostess at the New Congress Club with whom he has become infatuated. Prewitt shows Lorene a bugle mouth piece and proudly tells her, "I played taps at Arlington, they picked me to play taps at Arlington Cemetery on Armistice Day, the President was there."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Then the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Imperial_Forces" title="Japanese Imperial Forces">Japanese</a> attack <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" title="Pearl Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>. When Prewitt, still weak from his unhealed wound, finds out about the attack, he attempts to return to camp under cover of darkness, but is shot dead by a sentry. The boxing tournament is cancelled.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the end, Lorene and Karen meet on a ship leaving for the mainland. Karen then tosses two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lei" title="Lei">leis</a> into the water. She tells Lorene, "If the leis go to shore, a person will return to Hawaii. If the leis float out to sea, a person will never return." Lorene says she will never return, telling Karen that her fiancÃ© was an Army Air Corps pilot killed in a B-17 during the attack, but Karen recognizes Prewitt's name. Lorene holds Prewitt's treasured bugle mouth piece.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Legend has it that Frank Sinatra got the role in the movie because of his alleged <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> connections, and that this was the basis for a similar subplot in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>. This has been dismissed on several occasions, however, by the cast and crew of the film. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Zinneman" title="Fred Zinneman">Fred Zinneman</a> commented that "...the legend about a horse's head having been cut off is pure invention, a poetic license on the part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Puzo" title="Mario Puzo">Mario Puzo</a> who wrote <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather" title="The Godfather">The Godfather</a></i>." More plausible is the notion that Sinatra's then-wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ava_Gardner" title="Ava Gardner">Ava Gardner</a> persuaded studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>'s wife to use her influence with him; this version is related by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitty_Kelley" title="Kitty Kelley">Kitty Kelley</a> in her Sinatra biography. Sinatra himself had been bombarding Cohn with letters and telegrams asking to play the ill-fated Maggio, even signing some of the letters "Maggio". Sinatra benefited when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, who was originally cast as Maggio, dropped out to appear on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> instead. Sinatra gained the role, ultimately taking a pay cut in the process (earning $8,000, a huge drop from his $130,000 salary for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchors_Aweigh_(film)" title="Anchors Aweigh (film)">Anchors Aweigh</a></i>) to star in the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Sinatra's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen-test" title="Screen-test">screen-test</a> was used in the final cut of the film; the scene included Sinatra improvising with a handful of olives, pretending they were a pair of dice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The material of the rather explicit novel had to be considerably toned down to appease the censors of the time. For example, in the famous beach scene, it is less obvious that Kerr and Lancaster's characters are having sex than it is in the novel and in the later, more frank 1979 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_Here_to_Eternity_(TV_series)" title="From Here to Eternity (TV series)">miniseries</a> based on the book. Also left out of the film are Maggio being a male hustler and the portrait of the gay nightlife in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikiki" title="Waikiki">Waikiki</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The on-screen chemistry between Lancaster and Kerr may have spilled off-screen; it was alleged that the stars became romantically involved during filming.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A rumor has been circulating for years that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Reeves" title="George Reeves">George Reeves</a>, who played Sgt. Maylon Stark, had his role drastically edited after preview audiences recognized him as TV's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman" title="Superman">Superman</a></i>. This is depicted in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docudrama" title="Docudrama">docudrama</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywoodland" title="Hollywoodland">Hollywoodland</a></i>. However, Zinnemann maintains all his scenes were kept intact from the first draft, nor was there ever a preview screening.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> withheld its cooperation from the production (most of the movie was filmed where it was set, at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schofield_Barracks" title="Schofield Barracks">Schofield Barracks</a>, Hawaii) until the producers agreed to several modifications, most noticeably the fate of Captain Holmes. Numerous barracks locations are still intact and still occupied by active duty troops. In both the movie and the book the bar and restaurant called Choy's, where the fight scene takes place in the movie and where the novel opens is named Kemo'o (pronounced "kay-moe-o" in Hawaiian) Farms Bar and Grill. Choy's was chosen by James Jones in honor of Kemo'o Farms' head chef. Kemo'o Farms Bar and Grill is still in operation and remains deeply associated with the adjacent Schofield Barracks, and the cast and crew, especially Sinatra, are reputed to have patronized the bar to the point of excess.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two songs are noteworthy: "Re-Enlistment Blues" and "From Here to Eternity", by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wells" title="Robert Wells">Robert Wells</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karger" title="Fred Karger">Fred Karger</a>.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Reception">Reception</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Opening to rave reviews, <i>From Here to Eternity</i> proved to be an instant hit with critics and the public alike, the Southern California Motion Picture Council extolling: "A motion picture so great in its starkly realistic and appealing drama that mere words cannot justly describe it." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a> agreed: "The James Jones bestseller, 'From Here to Eternity,' has become an outstanding motion picture in this smash screen adaptation. It is an important film from any angle, presenting socko entertainment for big business. The cast names are exceptionally good, the exploitation and word-of-mouth values are topnotch, and the prospects in all playdates are very bright whether special key bookings or general run." </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the actors, <i>Variety</i> went on to say, "Burt Lancaster, whose presence adds measurably to the marquee weight of the strong cast names, wallops the character of Top Sergeant Milton Warden, the professional soldier who wetnurses a weak, pompous commanding officer and the GIs under him. It is a performance to which he gives depth of character as well as the muscles which had gained marquee importance for his name. Montgomery Clift, with a reputation for sensitive, three-dimensional performances, adds another to his growing list as the independent GI who refuses to join the company boxing team, taking instead the "treatment" dished out at the C.O.'s instructions. Frank Sinatra scores a decided hit as Angelo Maggio, a violent, likeable Italo-American GI. While some may be amazed at this expression of the Sinatra talent versatility, it will come as no surprise to those who remember the few times he has had a chance to be something other than a crooner in films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Post" title="The New York Post">The New York Post</a></i> applauded Frank Sinatra, remarking that "He proves he is an actor by playing the luckless Maggio with a kind of doomed gaity that is both real and immensely touching." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> also stated that "Frank Sinatra, a crooner long since turned actor, knew what he was doing when he plugged for the role of Maggio."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cast agreed, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster" title="Burt Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a> commenting in the book <i>Sinatra: An American Legend</i> that "His fervour (Sinatra), his bitterness had something to do with the character of Maggio, but also with what he had gone through the last number of years. A sense of defeat and the whole world crashing in on him... They all came out in that performance."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With a gross of $30.5 million equating to earnings of $12.2 million, <i>From Here to Eternity</i> was not only one of the top grossing films of 1953, but one of the ten highest-grossing films of the decade. Adjusted for inflation, its box office gross would be equivalent to in excess of $240 million U.S. in recent times.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">William Holden, who won the Best Actor Oscar for <i>Stalag 17</i>, felt that Lancaster should have won. Sinatra would later comment that he thought his performance of heroin addict Frankie Machine in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_With_the_Golden_Arm" title="The Man With the Golden Arm">The Man With the Golden Arm</a></i> was more deserving of an Oscar than his role as Maggio.</p>
