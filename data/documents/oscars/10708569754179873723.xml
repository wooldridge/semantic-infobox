      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the age of 17, Moore aspired to be a dancer. She started her career as "Happy Hotpoint", a tiny <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf" title="Elf">elf</a> dancing on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotpoint" title="Hotpoint">Hotpoint</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_appliance" title="Home appliance">appliances</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_commercial" title="Television commercial">TV commercials</a> during the 1950s series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Ozzie_and_Harriet" title="The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet">Ozzie and Harriet</a></i>. She filmed 39 TV commercials in five days, ultimately earning about $6,000 from her first job. Her time as "Happy Hotpoint" ended when it became difficult to conceal her pregnancy in the dancing elf <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume" title="Costume">costume</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moore modelled anonymously on the covers of a number of record albums and auditioned for the role of the older daughter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Thomas" title="Danny Thomas">Danny Thomas</a> for his long-running TV show, but was turned down. Much later, Thomas explained that "no daughter of mine could have that [little] nose."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her first regular television role was as a mysterious and glamorous telephone receptionist on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Diamond,_Private_Detective" title="Richard Diamond, Private Detective">Richard Diamond, Private Detective</a></i>; to add to the mystique, only her voice was heard and her shapely legs appeared on camera. About this time, she guest starred on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassavetes" title="John Cassavetes">John Cassavetes</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> detective series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Staccato" title="Johnny Staccato">Johnny Staccato</a></i>. In 1960, she guest starred in two episodes, "The O'Mara's Ladies" and "All The O'Mara's Horses", of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bendix" title="William Bendix">William Bendix</a>-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_McClure" title="Doug McClure">Doug McClure</a> NBC <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a> series, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Trail_(TV_series)" title="Overland Trail (TV series)">Overland Trail</a></i>. Several months later, she appeared in the first episode, entitled "One Blonde Too Many", of NBC one-season <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tab_Hunter_Show" title="The Tab Hunter Show">The Tab Hunter Show</a></i>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a> starring the former teen idol as a bachelor cartoonist.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961, Moore appeared in several bit parts in movies and on television, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_Street_Beat" title="Bourbon Street Beat">Bourbon Street Beat</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/77_Sunset_Strip" title="77 Sunset Strip">77 Sunset Strip</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfside_Six" title="Surfside Six">Surfside Six</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanted:_Dead_or_Alive_(TV_series)" title="Wanted: Dead or Alive (TV series)">Wanted: Dead or Alive</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Canyon" title="Steve Canyon">Steve Canyon</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_Eye" title="Hawaiian Eye">Hawaiian Eye</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock-Up_(TV_series)" title="Lock-Up (TV series)">Lock Up</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Reiner" title="Carl Reiner">Carl Reiner</a> cast her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dick_Van_Dyke_Show" title="The Dick Van Dyke Show">The Dick Van Dyke Show</a></i>, an acclaimed weekly series based on Reiner's own life and career as a writer for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Caesar" title="Sid Caesar">Sid Caesar</a>'s television variety show, telling the cast from the outset that it would run no more than five years. The show was produced by Danny Thomas's company, and Thomas himself recommended her. He remembered Mary as "the girl with three names" whom he had turned down earlier. Moore's energetic comic performances as Van Dyke's character's wife, begun at age 24 (hence she was 11 years Van Dyke's junior), made both the actress and her signature tight capri pants extremely popular, and she became internationally famous. When she won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> award for her portrayal of Laura Petrie, she said, "I know this will never happen again."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1970, after having appeared earlier in a pivotal one-hour musical special called "Dick Van Dyke and the Other Woman", Moore and husband Grant Tinker successfully pitched a sitcom centered on Moore to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Show" title="The Mary Tyler Moore Show">The Mary Tyler Moore Show</a></i> was a half-hour newsroom sitcom featuring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Asner" title="Ed Asner">Ed Asner</a> as her gruff boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Grant_(fictional_character)" title="Lou Grant (fictional character)">Lou Grant</a>, a character that would later be spun off into an hour-long dramatic series. The premise of the single working woman's life, alternating during the program between work and home, became a television staple that would often be used in the future. After six years of ratings in the top 20, the show slipped to number #39 during its seventh season. Producers argued for its cancellation because of its falling ratings, afraid that the show's legacy might be damaged if it were renewed for another season. To the surprise of the entire cast including Mary Tyler Moore herself, it was announced that they would soon be filming their final episode. After the announcement, the series finished strongly and the final show was the most watched show during the week it aired. The series had become a touchpoint of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_Movement" title="Women's Movement">Women's Movement</a> because it was one of the first to show, in a serious way, an independent working woman.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a brief respite, Moore threw herself into a completely different genre. She attempted two failed variety series in a row: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_(1978_TV_series)" title="Mary (1978 TV series)">Mary</a></i>, which featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Letterman" title="David Letterman">David Letterman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keaton" title="Michael Keaton">Michael Keaton</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swoosie_Kurtz" title="Swoosie Kurtz">Swoosie Kurtz</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Shawn" title="Dick Shawn">Dick Shawn</a> in the supporting cast and lasted three episodes, which was re-tooled as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mary_Tyler_Moore_Hour" title="The Mary Tyler Moore Hour">The Mary Tyler Moore Hour</a></i>, a backstage show within a show, with Mary portraying a TV star putting on a variety show. To arouse curiosity and nostalgic feelings, Dick Van Dyke appeared as her guest, but the program was canceled within three months. About this time, she also made a one-off musical/variety special for CBS, titled <i>Mary's Incredible Dream</i>, which featured <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ritter" title="John Ritter">John Ritter</a>, among others. It did poorly in the ratings and, according to Moore, was never repeated and will likely never be aired again because of legal problems surrounding the show.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1985â€“86 season, she returned to CBS in a series titled <i>Mary</i>, which suffered from poor reviews, sagging ratings, and internal strife within the production crew. According to Moore, she asked CBS to pull the show, as she was unhappy with the direction of the program and the producers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She also starred in the short-lived "warmedy", <i>Annie McGuire</i>, in 1988.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid-1990s, she had a cameo and a guest starring role as herself on two episodes of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_(TV_series)" title="Ellen (TV series)">Ellen</a></i>. She subsequently also guest starred on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_DeGeneres" title="Ellen DeGeneres">Ellen DeGeneres</a>'s next TV show, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ellen_Show" title="The Ellen Show">The Ellen Show</a></i>, in 2001.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2004, Moore reunited with her <i>Dick Van Dyke Show</i> castmates for a reunion "episode" called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dick_Van_Dyke_Show_Revisited" title="The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited">The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited</a></i>. In August 2005, Moore guest-starred as Christine St. George, a high-strung host of a fictional TV show on three episodes of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> sitcom <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show" title="That '70s Show">That '70s Show</a></i>. Moore's scenes were shot on the same soundstage where <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i> was filmed in the 1970s.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moore is set to guest-star in the season 2 premiere of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_in_Cleveland" title="Hot in Cleveland">Hot in Cleveland</a></i>. This will mark the first time since 1977 that actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_White" title="Betty White">Betty White</a> and Moore have worked together since <i>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moore appeared in several <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> plays. She starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whose_Life_Is_It_Anyway" title="Whose Life Is It Anyway">Whose Life Is It Anyway</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Naughton" title="James Naughton">James Naughton</a>, which opened on Broadway at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royale_Theatre" title="Royale Theatre">Royale Theatre</a> on February 24, 1980 and ran for 96 performances, and in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_Sue_(play)" title="Sweet Sue (play)">Sweet Sue</a></i>, which opened at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Box_Theatre" title="Music Box Theatre">Music Box Theatre</a> (transferred to the Royale Theatre) on Jan. 8, 1988 and ran for 164 performances. She was the star of a new musical version of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_(film)" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></i> in December 1966, but the show, titled <i>Holly Golightly</i>, was a notorious flop that closed out-of-town before reaching Broadway. In reviews of performances in Philadelphia and Boston, critics "murdered" the play in which Moore claimed to be singing with bronchial pneumonia.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared in previews of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Simon" title="Neil Simon">Neil Simon</a> play <i>Rose's Dilemma</i> at the off-Broadway <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Theatre_Club" title="Manhattan Theatre Club">Manhattan Theatre Club</a> in December 2003 but quit the production after receiving a critical letter from Simon instructing her to "learn your lines or get out of my play". Moore had been using an earpiece on stage to feed her lines to the repeatedly rewritten play.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1980s, Moore and her production company produced five plays: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noises_Off" title="Noises Off">Noises Off</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Octette_Bridge_Club" title="The Octette Bridge Club">The Octette Bridge Club</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Day_in_the_Death_of_Joe_Egg" title="A Day in the Death of Joe Egg">Joe Egg</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefactors_(play)" title="Benefactors (play)">Benefactors</a></i>, and <i>Safe Sex</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moore made her film debut in 1961's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-15_(film)" title="X-15 (film)">X-15</a></i>.

In 1969, she starred opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley" title="Elvis Presley">Elvis Presley</a> as a nun in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_Habit" title="Change of Habit">Change of Habit</a></i>. Moore's future television castmate <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Asner" title="Ed Asner">Ed Asner</a> also appeared in that film (as a cop). After that film's disappointing reviews and reception at the box office, Mary returned to television, and did not appear in another theatrical film for the next eleven years.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Moore was nominated for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for 1980's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_People" title="Ordinary People">Ordinary People</a></i>.

In one telling scene, she overhears her husband telling a friend at a party that their son has been seeing a psychiatrist. Then, on their way home in the car, she berates him angrily for revealing something she thinks should be private.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Conrad works through his minefield of emotions with Dr. Berger and learns to try and control his emotions less, he starts dating Jeannine (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_McGovern" title="Elizabeth McGovern">Elizabeth McGovern</a>), a kind and nonjudgmental girl from his school choir.
