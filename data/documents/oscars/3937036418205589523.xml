They were married in 1875, and became American citizens five years later on September 11, 1880.

He moved to California and began acting and working in film production for his older brother <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Ford_(actor)" title="Francis Ford (actor)">Francis</a> in 1914, taking "Jack Ford" as a stage name. In addition to credited roles, he appeared uncredited as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Klansman</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D.W._Griffith" title="D.W.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Directing_career">Directing career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">John Ford began his career in film after moving to California in July 1914. He followed in the footsteps of his multi-talented older brother Francis Ford, twelve years his senior, who had left home years earlier and had worked in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> before becoming a movie actor. Francis played in hundreds of silent pictures for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Melies" title="Georges Melies">Georges Melies</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_H._Ince" title="Thomas H. Ince">Thomas Ince</a>, eventually progressing to become a prominent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> actor-writer-director with his own production company (101 Bison) at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack Ford started out in his brother's films as an assistant, handyman, stuntman and occasional actor, frequently doubling for his brother, whom he closely resembled. Francis gave his younger brother his first acting role in <i>The Mysterious Rose</i> (November 1914). Despite an often combative relationship, within three years Jack had progressed to become Francis' chief assistant and often worked as his cameraman. By the time Jack Ford was given his first break as a director, Francis' profile was declining and he ceased working as a director soon afterward.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One notable feature of John Ford's films is that he used a 'stock company' of actors, far more so than many directors. Many famous stars appeared in at least two or more Ford films, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)" title="Harry Carey (actor born 1878)">Harry Carey, Sr.</a>, (the star of 25 Ford silents), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers" title="Will Rogers">Will Rogers</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woody_Strode" title="Woody Strode">Woody Strode</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Widmark" title="Richard Widmark">Richard Widmark</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_McLaglen" title="Victor McLaglen">Victor McLaglen</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Miles" title="Vera Miles">Vera Miles</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Hunter" title="Jeffrey Hunter">Jeffrey Hunter</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Likewise, Ford enjoyed extended working relationships with his production team, and many of his crew worked with him for decades.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his first decade as a director Ford honed his craft on dozens of features (including many westerns) but fewer than a dozen of the more than sixty silent films he made between 1917 and 1928 still exist in any form and only ten have survived in their entirety. However prints of several Ford 'silents' previously thought lost have been rediscovered in foreign film archives over recent yearsâ€”in 2009 a trove of 75 Hollywood silent films was rediscovered in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Film_Archive" title="New Zealand Film Archive">New Zealand Film Archive</a>, among which was the only surviving print of Ford's 1927 silent comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstream_(film)" title="Upstream (film)">Upstream</a></i>.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There is some uncertainty about the identity of Ford's first film as directorâ€”film writer Ephraim Katz notes that Ford might have directed the four-part film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lucille_The_Waitress_(film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Lucille The Waitress (film) (page does not exist)">Lucille the Waitress</a></i> as early as 1914â€”but most sources cite his directorial debut as the silent two-reeler <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tornado" title="The Tornado">The Tornado</a></i>, released in March 1917. According to Ford's own story, he was given the job by Universal boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle" title="Carl Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a> who supposedly said, "Give Jack Ford the jobâ€”he yells good". <i>The Tornado</i> was quickly followed by a string of two-reeler and three-reeler "quickies" - <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trail_of_Hate" title="The Trail of Hate">The Trail of Hate</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scrapper" title="The Scrapper">The Scrapper</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_Herder" title="The Soul Herder">The Soul Herder</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne%27s_Pal" title="Cheyenne's Pal">Cheyenne's Pal</a></i>; these were made over the space of a few months and each typically shot in just two or three days; all are now presumed lost. <i>The Soul Herder</i> is also notable as the beginning of Ford's four-year, 25-film association with veteran writer-actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)" title="Harry Carey (actor born 1878)">Harry Carey</a>, who (with Ford's brother Francis) was a strong early influence on the young director, as well as being one of the major influences on the screen persona of Ford's protege <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>. Carey's son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Carey,_Jr." title="Harry Carey, Jr.">Harry "Dobe" Carey Jr</a>, who also became an actor, was one of Ford's closest friends in later years and featured in many of his most celebrated westerns.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's first feature-length production was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straight_Shooting" title="Straight Shooting">Straight Shooting</a></i> (August 1917), which is also his earliest complete surviving film as director, and one of only two survivors from his twenty-five film collaboration with Harry Carey. In making the film Ford and Carey ignored studio orders and turned in five reels instead of two, and it was only through the intervention of Carl Laemmle that the film escaped being cut for its first release, although it was subsequently edited down to two reels for re-release in the late 1920s. Ford's last film of 1917, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucking_Broadway" title="Bucking Broadway">Bucking Broadway</a></i>, was long thought to have been lost, but in 2002 the only known surviving print was discovered in the archives of the French National Center for Cinematography and it has since been restored and digitized.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford directed around thirty-six films over three years for Universal before moving to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Century_Fox" title="20th Century Fox">William Fox</a> studio in 1920; his first film for them was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Pals" title="Just Pals">Just Pals</a></i> (1920). His 1923 feature <i>Cameo Kirby</i>, starring screen idol <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilbert_(actor)" title="John Gilbert (actor)">John Gilbert</a>â€”another of the few surviving Ford silentsâ€”marked his first directing credit under the name "John Ford", rather than "Jack Ford", as he had previously been credited.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's first major success as a director was the historical drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Iron_Horse_(film)" title="The Iron Horse (film)">The Iron Horse</a></i> (1924), an epic account of the building of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Transcontinental_Railroad" title="First Transcontinental Railroad">First Transcontinental Railroad</a>. It was a large, long and difficult production, filmed on location in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada</a>. The logistics were enormousâ€”two entire towns were constructed, there were 5000 extras, 100 cooks, 2000 rail layers, a cavalry regiment, 800 Indians, 1300 buffalo, 2000 horses, 10,000 cattle and 50,000 properties, including the original stagecoach used by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Greeley" title="Horace Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Bill_Hickok" title="Wild Bill Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derringer" title="Derringer">derringer</a> pistol and replicas of the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(locomotive)" title="Jupiter (locomotive)">Jupiter</a>" and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Pacific_No._119" title="Union Pacific No. 119">119</a>" locomotives that met at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promontory_Point" title="Promontory Point">Promontory Point</a> when the two ends of the line were joined on 10 May 1869.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's brother Eddie was a crew member and they fought constantly; on one occasion Eddie reportedly "went after the old man with a pick handle". There was only a short synopsis written when filming began and Ford wrote and shot the film day by day. Production fell behind schedule, delayed by constant bad weather and the intense cold, and Fox executives repeatedly demanded results, but Ford would either tear up the telegrams or hold them up and have stunt gunman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Edward_%22Pardner%22_Jones&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Edward &quot;Pardner&quot; Jones (page does not exist)">Edward "Pardner" Jones</a> shoot holes through the sender's name. Despite the pressure to halt the production, studio boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fox_(producer)" title="William Fox (producer)">William Fox</a> finally backed Ford and allowed him to finish the picture and his gamble paid off handsomelyâ€”<i>The Iron Horse</i> became one of the top-grossing films of the decade, taking over US$2 million worldwide, against a budget of $280,000.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford made a wide range of films in this period, and he became well-known for his Western and 'frontier' pictures, but the genre rapidly lost its appeal for major studios in the late 1920s. Ford's last silent Western was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Bad_Men" title="3 Bad Men">3 Bad Men</a></i> (1926), set during the Dakota land rush and filmed at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Hole" title="Jackson Hole">Jackson Hole</a>, Wyoming and in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. It would be thirteen years before he made his next Western, <i>Stagecoach</i>, in 1939.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the 1920s, Ford also served as president of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Directors_Association" title="Motion Picture Directors Association">Motion Picture Directors Association</a>, a forerunner to today's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America" title="Directors Guild of America">Directors Guild of America</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford was one of the pioneer directors of sound films; he shot Fox's first song sung on screen, for his film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Machree" title="Mother Machree">Mother Machree</a></i> (1928) of which only three of the original seven reels survive; this film is also notable as the first Ford film to feature the young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> (as an uncredited extra) and he appeared in Ford's next two movies. Ford also directed Fox's first all-talking dramatic feature <i>Napoleon's Barber</i> (1928), a 3-reeler which is also now lost.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just before the studio converted to talkies, Fox gave a contract to the German director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._W._Murnau" title="F. W. Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>, and his film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_(film)" title="Sunrise (film)">Sunrise</a></i> (1927), still highly regarded by critics, had a powerful effect on Ford. Murnau's influence can be seen in many of Ford's films of the late 1920s and early 1930s â€” his penultimate silent feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Sons" title="Four Sons">Four Sons</a></i> (1928), starring Victor McLaglen, was filmed on some of the lavish sets left over from Murnau's production. Ford's last silent feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman%27s_House" title="Hangman's House">Hangman's House</a></i> (1928) is notable as one of the first credited screen appearances by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Napoleon's Barber</i> was followed by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riley_the_Cop" title="Riley the Cop">Riley the Cop</a></i> (1928) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Boy" title="Strong Boy">Strong Boy</a></i> (1929), starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_McLaglen" title="Victor McLaglen">Victor McLaglen</a>, both of which are now lost (although Tag Gallagher's book records that the only surviving copy of <i>Strong Boy</i>, a 35Â mm nitrate print, was rumored to be held in a private collection in Australia). <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Watch" title="The Black Watch">The Black Watch</a></i> (1929), a colonial army adventure set in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khyber_Pass" title="Khyber Pass">Khyber Pass</a> starring Victor McLaglen and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a> is Ford's first complete surviving talking picture; it was remade in 1954 by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_King_(director)" title="Henry King (director)">Henry King</a> as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Khyber_Rifles_(film)" title="King of the Khyber Rifles (film)">King of the Khyber Rifles</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's output was fairly constant from 1928 to the start of World War II; he made five features in 1928 and then made either two or three films every year from 1929-1942 inclusive. Three films were released in 1929 -- <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_Boy" title="Strong Boy">Strong Boy</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Watch" title="The Black Watch">The Black Watch</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salute_(film)" title="Salute (film)">Salute</a></i>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's legendary efficiency and his ability to craft films combining artfulness with strong commercial appeal won him increasing renown and by 1940 he was acknowledged as one of the world's foremost movie directors. His growing prestige was reflected in his remunerationâ€”in 1920, when he moved to Fox, he was being paid $300â€“600 per week, but as his career took off in the mid-Twenties his annual income significantly increased. He earned nearly $134,000 in 1929, and he made over $100,000 per annum <i>every year</i> from 1934 to 1941, earning a staggering $220,068 in 1938 - more than double the salary of the U.S. President at that time (although this was still less than half the income of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Lombard" title="Carole Lombard">Carole Lombard</a>, Hollywood's highest-paid star of the 1930s, who was earning around $500,000 per year at the time).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With film production affected by the Depression, Ford made two films each in 1932 and 1933 - <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airmail_(film)" title="Airmail (film)">Airmail</a></i> (made for Universal) with a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bellamy" title="Ralph Bellamy">Ralph Bellamy</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesh" title="Flesh">Flesh</a></i> (for MGM) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Beery" title="Wallace Beery">Wallace Beery</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In making <i>Stagecoach</i> Ford faced entrenched industry prejudice about the now-hackneyed genre which, ironically, he had helped to make so popular. Although low-budget western features and serials were still being churned out in large numbers by '<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_Row" title="Poverty Row">Poverty Row</a>' studios, the genre had fallen out of favor with the big studios during the 1930s and they were regarded as B-grade 'pulp' movies at best. As a result, Ford shopped the project around Hollywood for almost a year, offering it unsuccessfully to both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kennedy" title="Joseph Kennedy">Joseph Kennedy</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Stagecoach</i> is significant for several reasonsâ€”it exploded industry prejudices by becoming both a critical and commercial hit, grossing over US$1 million in its first year (against a budget of just under $400,000), and its success singlehandedly revitalized the moribund genre, showing that Westerns could be "intelligent, artful, great entertainment -- and profitable". It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won two Oscars, for Best Supporting Actor (Thomas Mitchell) and Best Score. <i>Stagecoach</i> became the first in the series of seven classic Ford Westerns filmed on location in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley" title="Monument Valley">Monument Valley</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">John Wayne had good reason to be grateful for Ford's support, <i>Stagecoach</i> provided the actor with the career breakthrough that elevated him to international stardom. Over 35 years Wayne appeared in twenty-four of Ford's films (and three TV episodes). Ford is credited with playing a major role in shaping Wayne's screen image.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Stagecoach</i> marked the beginning of the most consistently successful phase of Ford's careerâ€”in just two years between 1939 and 1941 he created a string of classics films that won numerous Academy Awards. Ford's next film, the biopic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Mr_Lincoln" title="Young Mr Lincoln">Young Mr Lincoln</a></i> (1939) starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, was less successful than <i>Stagecoach</i>, attracting little critical attention and winning no awards. It was not a major box-office hit although it had a respectable domestic first year gross of $750,000, but Ford scholar Tag Gallagher describes it as "a deeper, more multi-leveled work than <i>Stagecoach</i> ....

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>How Green Was My Valley</i> became one of the biggest films of 1940.

Ford was also named Best Director by the New York Film Critics, and this was one of the few awards of his career that he collected in person (he generally shunned the Oscar ceremony).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During World War II, Commander John Ford, USNR, served in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> and made documentaries for the Navy Department.

He observed the first wave land on the beach from the ship, landing on the beach himself later with a team of US Coast Guard cameramen who filmed the battle from behind the beach obstacles, with Ford directing operations. The film was edited in London, but very little was released to the public. Ford explained in a 1964 interview that the US Government was "afraid to show so many American casualties on the screen", adding that all of the D-Day film "still exists in color in storage in Anacostia near Washington, D.C." Thirty years later, historian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_E._Ambrose" title="Stephen E. Ambrose">Stephen E.

According to records released in 2008, Ford was cited by his superiors for bravery, taking a position to film one mission that was "an obvious and clear target".

Ford repeatedly declared that he disliked the film and had never watched it, complaining that he had been forced to make it, although it was strongly championed by filmmaker <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Anderson" title="Lindsay Anderson">Lindsay Anderson</a>. Released several months after the end of the war, it was among the year's top 20 box-office draws, although Tag Gallagher notes that many critics have incorrectly claimed that it lost money.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford directed sixteen features and several documentaries in the decade between 1946 and 1956. As with his prewar career, his films alternated between (relative) box office flops and major successes, but most of his later films made a solid profit, and <i>Fort Apache</i>, <i>The Quiet Man</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mogambo" title="Mogambo">Mogambo</a></i> and <i>The Searchers</i> all ranked in the Top 20 box-office hits of their respective years.</p>

In contrast to the string of successes in 1939-41, it won no major American awards, although it was awarded a silver ribbon for Best Foreign Film in 1948 by the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists, and it was a solid financial success, grossing $2.75 million in the USA and $1.75 million internationally in its first year of release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Refusing a lucrative contract offered by Zanuck at 20th Century Fox that would have guaranteed him $600,000 per year, Ford launched himself as an independent director-producer and made many of his films in this period with Argosy Productions, a partnership between Ford and his old friend and colleague <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merian_C._Cooper" title="Merian C.

Ford reportedly considered this his best film but it fared relatively poorly compared to its predecessor, grossing only $750,000 in its first year. It also caused a rift between Ford and scriptwriter Dudley Nichols that brought about the end of their highly successful collaboration. Greene himself had a particular dislike of this adaptation of his work.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His only completed film of that year was the second installment of his Cavalry Trilogy, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Wore_A_Yellow_Ribbon" title="She Wore A Yellow Ribbon">She Wore A Yellow Ribbon</a></i> (Argosy/RKO, 1949), starring John Wayne and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Dru" title="Joanne Dru">Joanne Dru</a>, with Victor McLaglen, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Agar" title="John Agar">John Agar</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(actor)" title="Ben Johnson (actor)">Ben Johnson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Natwick" title="Mildred Natwick">Mildred Natwick</a> and Harry Carey Jr. Again filmed on location in Monument Valley, it was widely acclaimed for its stunning Technicolor cinematography (including the famous cavalry scene filmed in front of an oncoming storm); it won Winton Hoch the 1950 Academy Award for Best Color Cinematography and it did big business on its first release, grossing more than $5m worldwide.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1955, Ford made the lesser-known <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point" title="West Point">West Point</a> drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Gray_Line" title="The Long Gray Line">The Long Gray Line</a></i> for Columbia Pictures, the first of two Ford films to feature <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrone_Power" title="Tyrone Power">Tyrone Power</a>, who had originally been slated to star as the adult Huw in <i>How Green Was My Valley</i> back in 1941.

During a three-way meeting with producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland Hayward</a> to try and iron out the problems, Ford became enraged and punched Fonda on the jaw, knocking him across the room, an action that created a lasting rift between them. After the incident Ford became increasingly morose, drinking heavily and eventually retreating to the <i>Araner</i> and refusing to eat or see anyone. Production was shut down for five days and Ford sobered up, but soon after he suffered a ruptured gallbladder, necessitating emergency surgery, and he was replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mervyn_LeRoy" title="Mervyn LeRoy">Mervyn LeRoy</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford also made his first forays into television in 1955, directing two half-hour dramas for network TV. In the summer of 1955 he made <i>Rookie of the Year</i> (Hal Roach Studios) for the TV series <i>Studio Directors Playhouse</i>; scripted by Frank S. Nugent, it featured Ford regulars John and Pat Wayne, Vera Miles and Ward Bond, with Ford himself appearing in the introduction. In November he made <i>The Bamboo Cross</i> (Lewman Ltd-Revue, 1955) for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fireside_Theatre" title="Fireside Theatre">Fireside Theatre</a></i> series; it starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Wyman" title="Jane Wyman">Jane Wyman</a> with an Asian-American cast and Stock Company veterans Frank Baker and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_H._O%27Malley,_Jr." title="Patrick H.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford returned to the big screen with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_(film)" title="The Searchers (film)">The Searchers</a></i> (Warner Bros, 1956), the only Western he made between 1950 and 1959, which is now widely regarded as not only one of his best films, but also regarded by many as the greatest western ever made, and one of the best performances of John Wayne's career. Shot on location in Monument Valley, it tells of the embittered Civil War veteran Ethan Edwards who spends years tracking down his niece, kidnapped by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanches" title="Comanches">Comanches</a> as a young girl.

However its reputation has grown greatly over the intervening yearsâ€”it was named the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_10_Top_10" title="AFI's 10 Top 10">Greatest Western of all time</a> by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> in 2008 and also placed 12th on the Institute's 2007 list of the Top 100 greatest movies of all time.. <i>The Searchers</i> has exerted a wide influence on film and popular cultureâ€”it has inspired (and been directly quoted by) many filmmakers including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Lean" title="David Lean">David Lean</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a>, Wayne's character's catchphrase "That'll be the day" inspired Buddy Holly to pen his famous hit song of the same name, and the British pop group <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_(band)" title="The Searchers (band)">The Searchers</a> also took their name from the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>The Searchers</i> was accompanied by one of the first "making of" documentaries, a four-part promotional program created for the "Behind the Camera" segment of the weekly <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Brothers_Presents" title="Warner Brothers Presents">Warner Brothers Presents</a></i> TV show, (the studio's first foray into TV) which aired on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> network in 1955-56.

It was followed by one of Ford's least known films, <i>The Growler Story</i>, a 29-minute dramatized documentary about the <i>USS Growler</i>. Made for the US Navy and filmed by the Pacific Fleet Command Combat Camera Group, it featured Ward Bond and Ken Curtis alongside real Navy personnel and their families.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's next two films stand somewhat apart from the rest of his films in terms of production, and he notably took no salary for either job. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rising_of_the_Moon_(film)" title="The Rising of the Moon (film)">The Rising of the Moon</a></i> (Warner Bros, 1957) was a three-part 'omnibus' movie shot on location in Ireland and based on Irish short stories.

Killanin was also the actual (but uncredited) producer of <i>The Quiet Man</i>. The film failed to recoup its costs, earning less than half ($100k) its negative cost of just over $256,000 and it stirred up some controversy in Ireland.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both of Ford's 1958 films were made for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> and both were significant departures from Ford's norm. <i>Gideon's Day</i> (titled <i>Gideon of Scotland Yard</i> in the USA) was adapted from the novel by British writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Creasey" title="John Creasey">John Creasey</a>. It is Ford's only police genre film, and one of the few Ford films set in the present day of the 1950s. It was shot in England with a British cast headed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>, whom Ford (unusually) lauded as "the finest dramatic actor with whom I have worked". It was poorly promoted by Columbia, who only distributed it in B&amp;W, although it was shot in color, and it too failed to make a profit in its first year, earning only $400,000 against its budget of $453,000.</p>

Although Ford professed unhappiness with the project, it was a commercial success, ranking in the year's Top 20 box-office hits, grossing $3.6m in its first year, and earning Ford his highest-ever fee -- $375,000, plus 10% of the gross.</p>

It was erroneously marketed as a suspense film by Warners and was not a commercial success.

It is also notable as the film in which Wayne first used his trademark phrase "Pilgrim" (his nickname for James Stewart's character). It was very successful, grossing over $3m in its first year, although the lead casting stretched credibilityâ€”the characters played by Stewart (then 53) and Wayne (then 54) were meant to be in their early 20s, and Ford reportedly considered casting a younger actor in Stewart's role but feared it would highlight Wayne's age. Budget constraints meant that most of the film was shot on sets on the Paramount lot, although it was still one of Ford's most expensive films at US$3.2 million.</p>

Unusually for Ford it was shot in continuity for the sake of the performances and he therefore exposed about four times as much film as he usually shot. Anna Lee recalled that Ford was "absolutely charming" to everyone, and that the only major blow-up came when Flora Robson complained that the sign on her dressing room door did not include her title ("Dame") and as a result Robson was "absolutely shredded" by Ford in front of the cast and crew.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's next project, <i>The Miracle of Merriford</i> was scrapped by MGM less than a week before shooting was to have begun. His last completed work was <i>Chesty: A Tribute to a Legend</i>, a documentary on the most decorated U.S. Marine, General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chesty_Puller" title="Chesty Puller">Lewis B. Puller</a>, with narration by John Wayne, which was made in 1970 but not released until 1976, three years after Ford's death.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's health deteriorated rapidly in the early 1970s; he suffered a broken hip in 1970 which put him in a wheelchair, and had to move from his Bel Air home to a single-level house in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Desert" title="Palm Desert">Palm Desert</a>, near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenhower_Medical_Center" title="Eisenhower Medical Center">Eisenhower Medical Center</a>, where he was being treated for cancer.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford died on 31 August 1973 at Palm Desert, California, and his funeral was held on 5 September at Hollywood's Church of the Blessed Sacrament.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford was renowned for his intense personality and his many idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. From the early Thirties onwards, he always wore dark glasses and a patch over his left eye, which was only partly to protect his poor eyesight. He was an inveterate pipe-smoker and while he was shooting he would chew on a linen handkerchiefâ€”each morning his wife would give him a dozen fresh handkerchiefs, but by the end of a day's filming the corners of all of them would be chewed to shreds. He always had music played on the set and would routinely break for tea (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Grey" title="Earl Grey">Earl Grey</a>) at mid-afternoon every day during filming. He discouraged chatter and disliked bad language on set; its useâ€”especially in front of a womanâ€”would typically result in the offender being thrown off the production. He rarely drank during the making of a film, but when a production wrapped he would often lock himself in his study, wrapped only in a sheet, and go on a solitary drinking binge for several days, followed by routine contrition and a vow never to drink again. He was extremely sensitive to criticism and was always particularly angered by any comparison between his work and that of his older brother Francis. He almost never attended premieres or award ceremonies, although his Oscars and other awards were proudly displayed on the mantle in his home.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was famously untidy, and his study was always littered with books, papers and clothes. He bought a brand new Rolls Royce in the 1930s, but never rode in it because his wife Mary would not let him smoke in it. His own car, a battered Ford roadster, was so dilapidated and messy that he was once late for a studio meeting because the guard at the studio gate did not believe that he was John Ford the famous director, and refused to let him in. He was also notorious for his antipathy towards studio executives â€” on one early film for Fox he is said to have ordered a guard to keep studio boss <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" title="Darryl F. Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> off the set, and on another occasion he brought an executive in front of the crew, stood him in profile and announced, "This is an associate producer - take a good look because you won't be seeing him on this picture again".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His pride and joy was his yacht, <i>Araner</i>, which he bought in 1934 and on which he lavished hundreds of thousands of dollars in repairs and improvements over the years; it became his chief retreat between films and a meeting place for his circle of close (male) friends, including John Wayne and Ward Bond.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford was highly intelligent, erudite, sensitive and sentimental, but to protect himself in the cutthroat atmosphere of Hollywood he cultivated the image of a "tough, two-fisted, hard-drinking Irish sonofabitch" (Harry "Dobe" Carey Jr). One famous event, witnessed by Ford's friend actor Frank Baker, strikingly illustrates the tension between the public persona and the private man. During the Depression, Ford â€” by then a very wealthy man â€” was accosted outside his office by a former Universal actor who was destitute and needed $200 for an operation for his wife. As the man related his misfortunes, Ford appeared to become enraged and then, to the horror of onlookers, he launched himself at the man, knocked him to the floor and shouted "How dare you come here like this? Who do think you are to talk to me this way?" before storming out of the room. However, as the shaken old man left the building, Frank Baker saw Ford's business manager Fred Totman meet him at the door, where he handed the man a cheque for $1,000 and instructed Ford's chauffeur to drive him home. There, an ambulance was waiting to take the man's wife to the hospital where a specialist, flown in from San Francisco at Ford's expense, performed the operation. Some time later, Ford purchased a house for the couple and pensioned them for life. When Baker related the story to Francis Ford, he declared it the key to his brother's personality:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Ford had many affairs with women, there were occasional rumors about his sexual preferences, and in her 2004 autobiography '<i>Tis Herself</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a> recalled seeing Ford kissing a famous male actor (whom she did not name) in his office at Columbia Studios.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford had many distinctive stylistic 'trademarks' and a suite of thematic preoccupations and visual and aural <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(narrative)" title="Motif (narrative)">motifs</a> recurs throughout his work as a director. Film journalist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephraim_Katz" title="Ephraim Katz">Ephraim Katz</a> summarised some of the keynote features of Ford's work in his Collins <i>Film Enclopedia</i> entry:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to his contemporary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, Ford never used storyboards, composing his pictures entirely in his head, without any written or graphic outline of the shots he would use. Script development could be intense but, once approved, his screenplays were rarely rewritten; he was also one of the first filmmakers to encourage his writers and actors to prepare a full <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_story" title="Back story">back story</a> for their characters. He hated long expository scenes and was famous for tearing pages out of a script to cut dialogue. During the making of one film, when challenged by a studio executive about falling behind schedule, Ford responded by tearing an entire scene out of the script and declaring "There, now we're all caught up!", and indeed he never filmed the scene. While making <i>Drums Along the Mohawk</i>, Ford neatly sidestepped the challenge of shooting a large and expensive battle sceneâ€”he had <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> improvise a monologue while firing questions from behind the camera about the course of the battle (a subject on which Fonda was well-versed) and then simply editing out the questions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was relatively sparing in his use of camera movements and close-ups, preferring static medium or long shots, with his players framed against dramatic vistas or interiors lit in an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressionism" title="Expressionism">Expressionistic</a> style, although he often used panning shots and sometimes used a dramatic zoom-in (e.g. John Wayne's first appearance in <i>Stagecoach</i>). Ford is justly famous for his exciting tracking shots, such as the chase sequence in <i>Stagecoach</i> or the attack on the Comanche camp in <i>The Searchers</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Recurring visual motifs include trains and wagonsâ€”many Ford films begin and end with a linking vehicle such as a train or wagon arriving and leavingâ€”doorways, roads, flowers, rivers, gatherings (parades, dances, meetings, bar scenes, etc.); he also employed gestural motifs in many films, notably the throwing of objects and the lighting of lamps, matches or cigarettes. If a doomed character was shown playing poker (such as Liberty Valance or gunman Tom Tyler in <i>Stagecoach</i>), the last hand he plays is the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_hand" title="Dead man's hand">death hand</a>"â€”two eights and two aces, one of them the ace of spadesâ€”so-called because <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Bill_Hickok" title="Wild Bill Hickok">Wild Bill Hickok</a> is said to have held this hand when he was murdered. Many of his sound films include renditions or quotations of his favorite hymn, "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shall_We_Gather_at_the_River%3F" title="Shall We Gather at the River?">Shall We Gather at the River?</a>", such as its parodic use to underscore the opening scenes of <i>Stagecoach</i>, when the prostitute Dallas is being run out of town by local matrons. Character names also recur in many Ford films â€” the name Quincannon, for example, is used in several films including <i>The Lost Patrol</i>, <i>Rio Grande</i>, <i>She Wore A Yellow Ribbon</i> and <i>Fort Apache</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford was legendary for his discipline and efficiency on-set and was notorious for being extremely tough on his actors, frequently mocking, yelling and bullying them; he was also infamous for his sometimes sadistic practical jokes. Any actor foolish enough to demand star treatment would receive the full force of his relentless scorn and sarcasm. He once referred to John Wayne as a "big idiot" and even punched <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Brandon_(actor)" title="Henry Brandon (actor)">Henry Brandon</a> (who played Chief Scar from <i>The Searchers</i>) once referred to Ford as: "The only man who could make John Wayne cry.". He likewise belittled Victor McLaglen, on one occasion reportedly bellowing through the megaphone: "D'ya known, McLaglen, that Fox are paying you $1200 a week to do things that I could get any child off the street to do better?". Stock Company veteran <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Bond" title="Ward Bond">Ward Bond</a> was reportedly one of the few actors who was impervious to Ford's taunting and sarcasms.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford usually gave his actors little explicit direction, although on occasion he would casually walk through a scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On <i>The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance</i>, Ford ran through a scene with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_O%27Brien" title="Edmund O'Brien">Edmund O'Brien</a> and ended by drooping his hand over a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing his hand <i>on</i> the railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his often difficult and demanding personality, many actors who worked with Ford acknowledged that he brought out the best in them. John Wayne remarked that "Nobody could handle actors and crew like Jack." and Dobe Carey stated that "He had a quality that made everyone almost kill themselves to please him. Upon arriving on the set, you would feel right away that something special was going to happen. You would feel spiritually awakened all of a sudden." Carey credits Ford with the inspiration of Carey's final film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_Stallion" title="Comanche Stallion">Comanche Stallion</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_in_film" title="2005 in film">2005</a>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford's favorite location for his Western films was southern <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Valley" title="Monument Valley">Monument Valley</a>. Although not generally appropriate geographically as a setting for his plots, the expressive visual impact of the area enabled Ford to define images of the American West with some of the most beautiful and powerful cinematography ever shot, in such films as <i>Stagecoach</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Searchers_(film)" title="The Searchers (film)">The Searchers</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Apache_(film)" title="Fort Apache (film)">Fort Apache</a></i>. A notable example is the famous scene in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/She_Wore_a_Yellow_Ribbon" title="She Wore a Yellow Ribbon">She Wore a Yellow Ribbon</a></i> in which the cavalry troop is photographed against an oncoming storm. The influence on the films of classic Western artists such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederic_Remington" title="Frederic Remington">Frederic Remington</a> and others has been examined. Ford's evocative use of the territory for his Westerns has defined the images of the American West so powerfully that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> once said that other film-makers refused to shoot in the region out of fears of plagiarism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ford typically shot only the footage he needed and often filmed in sequence, minimizing the job of his film editors. In the opinion of Joseph McBride , Ford's technique of cutting in the camera enabled him to retain creative control in a period where directors often had little say on the final editing of their films. Ford noted:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In making <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i> (which runs 128 mins) Ford reportedly exposed just 40,000 feet of film, which equates to the remarkably low <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_ratio" title="Shooting ratio">shooting ratio</a> of 4:1. The shooting ratio for feature films typically ranges from 6:1 to 10:1 or more and, by comparison, it is reported that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a> shot almost 1 million feet of film in the making of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dances_With_Wolves" title="Dances With Wolves">Dances With Wolves</a></i> (which runs 180 mins)</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As time went on, however, Ford became more publicly allied with the Republican Party, declaring himself a 'Maine Republican' in 1947.
