	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Gloria Grahame</b> (November 28, 1923 â€“ October 5, 1981) was an American actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame began her acting career in theatre, and in 1944 she made her first film for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a>. Despite a featured role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i> (1946), MGM did not believe she had the potential for major success, and sold her contract to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Studios" title="RKO Studios">RKO Studios</a>. Often cast in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a> projects, Grahame received a nomination for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(film)" title="Crossfire (film)">Crossfire</a></i> (1947), and she won this award for her work in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_and_the_Beautiful" title="The Bad and the Beautiful">The Bad and the Beautiful</a></i> (1952). She achieved her highest profile with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Fear" title="Sudden Fear">Sudden Fear</a></i> (1952), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Desire" title="Human Desire">Human Desire</a></i> (1953),<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Heat" title="The Big Heat">The Big Heat</a></i> (1953), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma!_(film)" title="Oklahoma! (film)">Oklahoma!</a></i> (1955), but her film career began to wane soon afterwards.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She returned to work on the stage, but continued to appear in films and television productions, usually in supporting roles. Diagnosed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach_cancer" title="Stomach cancer">stomach cancer</a> in 1980, Grahame refused to accept the diagnosis and travelled to England to work in a play. Her health rapidly failed and she returned to New York City, where she died in 1981.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame was born <b>Gloria Hallward</b> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. Reginald Michael Bloxam Hallward, her father, was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect" title="Architect">architect</a> and author and her mother, Jeanne McDougall, who used the stage name Jean Grahame, was a British stage actress and acting teacher.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She made her film debut in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Blonde_Fever&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Blonde Fever (page does not exist)">Blonde Fever</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1944_in_film" title="1944 in film">1944</a>) and scored one of her most widely praised roles as the promiscuous Violet, who is saved from disgrace by George Bailey in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1946_in_film" title="1946 in film">1946</a>). MGM was not able to develop her potential as a star and her contract was sold to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO_Studios" title="RKO Studios">RKO Studios</a> in 1947.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame was often featured in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_noir" title="Film noir">film noir</a> pictures as a tarnished beauty with an irresistible sexual allure. During this time, she made films for several Hollywood studios. She received an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Best Supporting Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossfire_(film)" title="Crossfire (film)">Crossfire</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1947_in_film" title="1947 in film">1947</a>).</p>

However, she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in MGM's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_and_the_Beautiful" title="The Bad and the Beautiful">The Bad and the Beautiful</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_in_film" title="1952 in film">1952</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other memorable roles included the scheming Irene Nieves in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Fear" title="Sudden Fear">Sudden Fear</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1952_in_film" title="1952 in film">1952</a>), the <i>femme fatale</i> Vicki Buckley in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Desire" title="Human Desire">Human Desire</a></i> (1953), and mob moll Debby Marsh in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Lang" title="Fritz Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Heat" title="The Big Heat">The Big Heat</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1953_in_film" title="1953 in film">1953</a>) in which, in a horrifying scene, she is scarred by hot coffee thrown in her face offscreen by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Marvin" title="Lee Marvin">Lee Marvin</a>'s character.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame's career began to wane after her performance in the musical movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma!_(film)" title="Oklahoma! (film)">Oklahoma!</a></i> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1955_in_film" title="1955 in film">1955</a>). Grahame, whom audiences were used to seeing as a film noir siren, was miscast as an ignorant country lass in a wholesome musical, and the paralysis of her upper lip from plastic surgery altered her speech and appearance. She began a slow return to the theater, and returned to films occasionally to play supporting roles, mostly in minor releases. She appeared on television too, including an episode of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom" title="Sitcom">sitcom</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrigan_and_Son" title="Harrigan and Son">Harrigan and Son</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_O%27Brien_(actor)" title="Pat O'Brien (actor)">Pat O'Brien</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame has a star on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame" title="Hollywood Walk of Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> for her contribution to Motion Pictures, at 6522 Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Personal_life">Personal life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grahame had a string of stormy romances and failed marriages during her time in Hollywood, including marriages to director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Ray" title="Nicholas Ray">Nicholas Ray</a> and later to Ray's son, with whom she had an affair while still married to Ray. All of this took a toll on her career, as did a two-year hiatus taken after the birth of her daughter in 1956. Marital and child custody problems hampered her performance on the set of <i>Oklahoma!</i> Additionally, the actress's concern over the appearance of her upper lip led her to pursue plastic surgery and dental operations that caused visible scarring and ultimately rendered the lip largely immobile due to nerve damage, which affected her speech.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Powell" title="Dick Powell">Dick Powell</a>), movie star Georgia Lorrison (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a>), and director Fred Amiel (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sullivan_(actor)" title="Barry Sullivan (actor)">Barry Sullivan</a>) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>) in Paris.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Shields next encounters alcoholic small-time actress Lorrison, the daughter of a famous actor Shields admired. He builds up her confidence and gives her the leading role in one of his movies over everyone else's objections. When she falls in love with him, he lets her think that he feels the same way in order to get the performance he needs. After a smash premiere makes her a star overnight, she finds him with a beautiful bit player named Laila (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elaine_Stewart" title="Elaine Stewart">Elaine Stewart</a>). He drives Lorrison away, telling her that he will never allow anyone to have that much control over him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Finally, Bartlow is a contented professor at a small college who has written a bestselling book. Shields wants to turn it into a film and have him write the script. Bartlow is not interested, but his shallow Southern belle wife, Rosemary (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloria_Grahame" title="Gloria Grahame">Gloria Grahame</a>) is, so he agrees to do it for her sake. They go to Hollywood, where Shields is annoyed to find that her constant distractions are keeping her husband from his work. He gets his suave actor friend Victor "Gaucho" Ribera (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Roland" title="Gilbert Roland">Gilbert Roland</a>) to keep her occupied. Freed from interruption, Bartlow has no trouble finishing the script. Rosemary, however, runs off with Gaucho and they are killed in a plane crash. When Shields slips and reveals his involvement, Bartlow leaves too.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There has been much debate as to which real-life Hollywood legends are represented by the film's characters. Jonathan Shields is thought to be a blending of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Lewton" title="Val Lewton">Val Lewton</a>. Lewton's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_People" title="Cat People">Cat People</a></i> is clearly the inspiration behind an early Shields-Amiel film. The Georgia Lorrison character is the daughter of a "Great Profile" actor like <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barrymore" title="John Barrymore">John Barrymore</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Barrymore" title="Diana Barrymore">Diana Barrymore</a>'s career was in fact launched the same year as her father's death), but it can also be argued that Lorrison includes elements of Minnelli's ex-wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Roland" title="Gilbert Roland">Gilbert Roland</a>'s Gaucho may almost be seen as self-parody, as he had recently starred in a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco_Kid" title="Cisco Kid">Cisco Kid</a> pictures, though the character's name, Ribera, would seem to give a nod also to famed Hollywood seducer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porfirio_Rubirosa" title="Porfirio Rubirosa">Porfirio Rubirosa</a>.
