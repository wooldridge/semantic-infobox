Fred was a decorated Army Air Forces captain and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombardier_(air_force)" title="Bombardier (air force)">bombardier</a> with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth Air Force</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, who still suffers from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder" title="Post-traumatic stress disorder">nightmares of combat</a>. Homer had been in the Navy, where he lost both hands from burns suffered when his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> was sunk. For replacements, he has mechanical hook <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostheses" title="Prostheses">prostheses</a> (as Harold Russell had, so no artifice was required).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prior to the war, Al had worked as a bank executive and loan officer for the Corn Belt Savings and Loan in Boone City. He is a mature man with a loving family and comfortable home: his patient wife Milly (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a>), adult daughter Peggy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Wright" title="Teresa Wright">Teresa Wright</a>) and college freshman son Rob.

      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before the war, Fred had been an unskilled drugstore <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soda_jerk" title="Soda jerk">soda jerk</a>, having been raised in a poor neighborhood. He does not want to return to his old job, but has no choice, given the stiff competition from other returning veterans and his lack of civilian skills. He had met Marie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Mayo" title="Virginia Mayo">Virginia Mayo</a>) while in training and married her shortly afterward, before shipping out less than a month later. She took a job as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_club" title="Night club">night club</a> waitress and set up her own apartment while Fred was overseas. She does not relish being married to a soda jerk and seemed more attracted to Fred as an officer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy meets Fred after coming home with her father Al following an alcohol-fueled "reunion" at a local watering hole owned by Homer's uncle, Butch (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoagy_Carmichael" title="Hoagy Carmichael">Hoagy Carmichael</a>). The relationship between Peggy and Fred begins slowly, but there is a mutual attraction almost from the start. After a double-date with Fred and Marie, Peggy is contemptuous of Marie, believing she is shallow. Peggy tells her parents she intends to break up Fred and Marie's marriage, only to be told that their own marriage overcame similar problems. To protect Peggy, Al pressures Fred to break off all contact with his daughter. Fred does so, but the friendship between the two men is strained almost to the breaking point.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Homer was a football <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback" title="Quarterback">quarterback</a> before the war. Before leaving to fight, he had become engaged to Wilma (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O%27Donnell" title="Cathy O'Donnell">Cathy O'Donnell</a>). When he returns, both Homer and his parents have trouble dealing with his disability. He does not want to burden Wilma with a handicapped man, so he pushes her away, although she adjusts best to his changed life. His uncle Butch owns a bar where the three men meet from time to time. Butch counsels Homer, but refrains from telling his nephew what to do.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the drugstore where Fred works, an obnoxious customer, who says that the war was fought against the wrong enemies, gets into an altercation with Homer. After Fred punches the troublemaker, he loses his job. One day when Fred returns home from collecting his unemployment check and job hunting, he discovers his wife with another man (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cochran" title="Steve Cochran">Steve Cochran</a> in an early role as another veteran). Marie exclaims:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fred decides to leave town, and goes to his father's house to say goodbye. He gives his father, Pat Derry, his medals and citations, saying dismissively that they were "passed out with the k-rations." After he leaves, his father reads aloud the citation for Fred's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> citation. For the first time, he learns of his son's extraordinary heroism.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Arriving at the airport, Fred books space on the first outbound transport, not caring about the destination. While waiting departure, Fred walks around the airport to kill time and wanders into a vast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_boneyard" title="Aircraft boneyard">wartime aircraft "boneyard"</a>. Climbing into the nose of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-17_Flying_Fortress" title="B-17 Flying Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a>, he begins to relive intense memories of combat. The boss of a work crew interrupts him. Fred had thought of the aircraft as unwanted debris to be thrown away, like him. When the crew chief says the aluminum is being salvaged to build housing, Fred talks him into a job.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Casting brought together established stars as well as character actors and relative unknowns. Famed drummer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Krupa" title="Gene Krupa">Gene Krupa</a> was seen in archival footage, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Ernie_Ford" title="Tennessee Ernie Ford">Tennessee Ernie Ford</a>, later a famous television star, appeared as an uncredited "hillbilly singer" (in the first of his only three film appearances).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director William Wyler had flown combat missions over Europe in filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Belle:_A_Story_of_a_Flying_Fortress" title="Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress">Memphis Belle</a></i> (1944) and worked hard to get accurate depictions of the combat veterans he had encountered.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i>, he asked the principal actors to purchase their own clothes, in order to connect with daily life and produce an authentic feeling. Other Wyler touches included constructing life-size sets, which went against the standard larger sets that were more suited to camera positions. The impact for the audience was immediate, as each scene played out in a realistic, natural way.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie began filming on April 15, 1946 at a variety of locations, including the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_County_Arboretum_and_Botanic_Garden" title="Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden">Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_International_Airport" title="Ontario International Airport">Ontario International Airport</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario,_California" title="Ontario, California">Ontario, California</a>, Raleigh Studios, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> and the Samuel Goldwyn/Warner Hollywood Studios. Many scenes were also filmed in Phoenxiville, PA, most notably the banking scenes using the Farmers and Mechanics Bank located on Main Street and various other scenes showing Bridge Street and Main Street in Phoenixville, PA. <i>The Best Years of Our Lives</i> is notable for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> Gregg Toland's use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_focus" title="Deep focus">deep focus</a> photography, in which objects both close to and distant from the camera are in sharp <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_(optics)" title="Focus (optics)">focus</a>. For the passage of Fred Derry's reliving a combat mission while sitting in the remains of a former bomber, Wyler used "zoom" effects to simulate an aircraft's taking off.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The "Jackson High" football stadium seen early in the movie in aerial footage was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corcoran_Stadium" title="Corcoran Stadium">Corcoran Stadium</a>, the home of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_University" title="Xavier University">Xavier University</a>'s (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>) football team from 1929 to 1973.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the war, the combat aircraft featured in the film were being destroyed and disassembled for reuse as scrap material. The scene of Derry's walking among aircraft ruins was filmed at the Ontario Army Air Field in Ontario, California. The former training facility had been converted into a scrap yard, housing nearly 2,000 former combat aircraft in various states of disassembly.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon its release, the film received extremely positive reviews from critics. Shortly after its premiere at the Astor Theater, New York, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a>, film critic for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a>,</i> hailed the film as a masterpiece. He wrote,</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He also said the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_cast" title="Ensemble cast">ensemble casting</a> gave the "'best' performance in this best film this year from Hollywood."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A contemporary critic, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Kehr" title="Dave Kehr">Dave Kehr</a>, wrote,</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thomson" title="David Thomson">David Thomson</a> offers tempered praise: "I would concede that <i>Best Years</i> is decent and humane... acutely observed, despite being so meticulous a package. It would have taken uncommon genius and daring at that time to sneak a view of an untidy or unresolved America past Goldwyn or the public."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Not everyone was as complimentary. The critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Farber" title="Manny Farber">Manny Farber</a> called it "a horse-drawn truckload of liberal schmaltz."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In July 2010, the film has a 97% "Fresh" rating at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, based on 35 reviews. The film enjoys a 100% "Fresh" rating on the site's "Top Critics" section, based on 8 reviews.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a massive popular success. When box office prices are adjusted for inflation, it remains one of the top 100 grossing films in U.S. history. Among films released before 1950, only <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bells_of_St._Mary%27s" title="The Bells of St. Mary's">The Bells of St. Mary's</a></i> and four Disney titles have done more total business, in part due to later re-releases. (Reliable box office figures for certain early films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_of_a_Nation" title="Birth of a Nation">Birth of a Nation</a></i> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>'s comedies are unavailable.) </p>

The film received seven Academy Awards. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_March" title="Fredric March">Fredric March</a> won his second Best Actor award (after winning in 1932 for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Jekyll_and_Mr._Hyde_(1931_film)" title="Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a></i>). (Dana Andrews' brilliant performance turned out to be overshadowed by the acclaim Fredric March and Harold Russell received.)</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his Oscar-nominated performance, Harold Russell was not a professional actor. As the Academy Board of Governors considered him a long shot to win, they gave him an honorary award "for bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans through his appearance". When Russell won Best Supporting Actor, there was an enthusiastic response. He is the only actor to have received two Academy Awards for the same performance. He later sold one of the awards for $50,000, first claiming it was to pay his wife's medical bills. Later he said it was to pay for a cruise for her. He often joked, "I can pick up anything but the check!"</p>
