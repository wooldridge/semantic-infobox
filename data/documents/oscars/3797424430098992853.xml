Her mother, Catherine Estelle (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Hayes), or Essie, was an aspiring actress who worked in touring companies.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hayes began a stage career at an early age. She said her stage debut was a 5-year old singer at Washington's Belasco Theatre (on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.) By the age of ten, she had made a short film called <i>Jean and the Calico Doll</i>, but only moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> when her husband, playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_MacArthur" title="Charles MacArthur">Charles MacArthur</a>, signed a Hollywood deal. She attended the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrine_of_the_Sacred_Heart#Sacred_Heart_School" title="Shrine of the Sacred Heart">Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent</a> in Washington and graduated in 1917.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her sound film debut was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sin_of_Madelon_Claudet" title="The Sin of Madelon Claudet">The Sin of Madelon Claudet</a></i>, for which she won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. She followed that with starring roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowsmith_(film)" title="Arrowsmith (film)">Arrowsmith</a></i> (with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a>), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Farewell_to_Arms" title="A Farewell to Arms">A Farewell to Arms</a></i> (with actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>, whom Hayes admitted to finding extremely attractive), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_White_Sister_(1933_film)" title="The White Sister (1933 film)">The White Sister</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Every_Woman_Knows" title="What Every Woman Knows">What Every Woman Knows</a></i> (a reprise from her Broadway hit) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vanessa:_Her_Love_Story&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Vanessa: Her Love Story (page does not exist)">Vanessa: Her Love Story</a></i>. However, she never became a fan favorite and Hayes did not prefer the medium to the stage.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hayes eventually returned to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Miller" title="Gilbert Miller">Gilbert Miller</a> production of <i>Victoria Regina</i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Price" title="Vincent Price">Vincent Price</a> as Prince Albert, first at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadhurst_Theatre" title="Broadhurst Theatre">Broadhurst Theatre</a> and later at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Beck_Theatre" title="Martin Beck Theatre">Martin Beck Theatre</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Siddons_Award" title="Sarah Siddons Award">Sarah Siddons Award</a> for her work in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_theatre" title="Chicago theatre">Chicago theatre</a>, repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise.

Her performance in <i>Anastasia</i> was considered a comebackâ€”she had suspended her career for several years due to the death of her daughter Mary, and her husband's failing health.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1955 the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulton_Theatre/Helen_Hayes_Theatre" title="Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre">Fulton Theatre</a> was renamed for her. However, business interests in the 1980s wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquis_Theatre" title="Marquis Theatre">Marquis Theatre</a>. To accomplish razing this theatre and three others, as well as the Astor Hotel, the business interests received Hayes' consent to raze the theatre named for her, even though she had no ownership interest in the buildings. Parts of the original Helen Hayes theatre on Broadway were used to construct <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shakespeare_Center" title="The Shakespeare Center">The Shakespeare Center</a> on the Upper Westside of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Papp" title="Joseph Papp">Joseph Papp</a> in 1982. In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was re-named The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hayes_Theatre" title="Helen Hayes Theatre">Helen Hayes Theatre</a> in her honor; as was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helen_Hayes_Theatre_(Nyack)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Helen Hayes Theatre (Nyack) (page does not exist)">a theatre in Nyack</a>, which has since been re-named the Riverspace-Arts Center.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is unclear who or when the title of "First Lady of the Theatre" was bestowed upon Hayes. Her friend, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a> also held that title, and each thought that the other deserved it.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1982, with friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_Johnson" title="Lady Bird Johnson">Lady Bird Johnson</a>, she founded the National Wildflower Research Center, now the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Bird_Johnson_Wildflower_Center" title="Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center">Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas" title="Austin, Texas">Austin, Texas</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hayes wrote three memoirs: <i>A Gift of Joy</i>, <i>On Reflection</i> and <i>My Life in Three Acts</i>.

Hayes's adopted son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacArthur" title="James MacArthur">James MacArthur</a>, went on to a career in acting, starring in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii_Five-O" title="Hawaii Five-O">Hawaii Five-O</a></i> on television. (Hayes herself guest starred on a 1975 episode of <i>Hawaii Five-0</i>, playing the aunt of MacArthur's character.)</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hayes was hospitalized a number of times for her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma" title="Asthma">asthma</a> condition, which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from legitimate theater in 1971, at age 71. Her last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_(play)" title="Harvey (play)">Harvey</a>, in which she co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film originally was titled <i>The Lullaby</i>. Following its first preview, it was panned by critics, who were impressed by Hayes in her film debut, but thought the plot was conventional and sappy. Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a> called in playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_MacArthur" title="Charles MacArthur">Charles MacArthur</a>, who was Hayes' husband, to doctor the script. He thoroughly revised it, omitting inconsequential characters and framing the story as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hayes had begun filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowsmith_(film)" title="Arrowsmith (film)">Arrowsmith</a></i> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> and had to complete that project before shooting her new scenes for the Thalberg film. It was retitled <i>The Sin of Madelon Claudet</i> and opened to widespread acclaim for both Hayes and the film itself .</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was voted one of the ten best pictures of the year by a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Daily" title="Film Daily">Film Daily</a></i> nationwide poll.</p>

It is endowed with other commendable impersonations . . . [and] also has the benefit of Edgar Selwyn's expert direction." </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> said the film was "remarkable because in it Helen Hayes appears in cinema for the first time and because it succeeds in its intention â€” to make audiences weep . . . By ceasing entirely to be Helen Hayes and becoming instead the woman whose life story she portrays, Cinemactress Hayes makes the familiarity of the story double its sadness . . . The picture is well directed by Edgar Selwyn [and] splendidly acted by the rest of the cast." </p>
