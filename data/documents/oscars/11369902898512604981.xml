Her voice was damaged by a throat operation in 1997.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andrews had a major revival of her film career in 2000s in family films such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_(film)" title="The Princess Diaries (film)">The Princess Diaries</a></i> (2001), its sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Diaries_2:_Royal_Engagement" title="The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement">The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement</a></i> (2004), and the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek">Shrek</a></i> animated films (2004â€“2010). In 2003 Andrews revisited her first Broadway success, this time as a stage director, with a revival of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Friend" title="The Boy Friend">The Boy Friend</a></i> at the Bay Street Theatre, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sag_Harbor,_New_York" title="Sag Harbor, New York">Sag Harbor, New York</a> (and later at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodspeed_Opera_House" title="Goodspeed Opera House">Goodspeed Opera House</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Haddam,_Connecticut" title="East Haddam, Connecticut">East Haddam, Connecticut</a> in 2005).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andrews is also an author of children's books, and in 2008 published an autobiography, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home:_A_Memoir_of_My_Early_Years" title="Home: A Memoir of My Early Years">Home: A Memoir of My Early Years</a></i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julie Andrews was born <b>Julia Elizabeth Wells</b> on 1 October 1935 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walton-on-Thames" title="Walton-on-Thames">Walton-on-Thames</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey" title="Surrey">Surrey</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. Her mother, Barbara Wells (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Morris), was married to Edward C. "Ted" Wells, a teacher of metal and woodworking, but Andrews was conceived as a result of an affair her mother had with a family friend.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the outbreak of World War II, Barbara and Ted Wells went their separate ways. Ted Wells assisted with evacuating children to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey" title="Surrey">Surrey</a> during <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz" title="The Blitz">the Blitz</a>, while Barbara joined Ted Andrews in entertaining the troops through the good offices of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainments_National_Service_Association" title="Entertainments National Service Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA). Barbara and Ted Wells were soon divorced. They both remarried: Barbara to Ted Andrews, in 1939; and Ted Wells, to a former hairstylist working a lathe at a war factory that employed them both in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinchley_Wood" title="Hinchley Wood">Hinchley Wood</a>, Surrey.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julia Wells lived briefly with Ted Wells and her brother John in Surrey. In about 1940, Ted Wells sent Julia to live with her mother and stepfather, who, the elder Wells thought, would be better able to provide for his talented daughter's artistic training. According to her 2008 autobiography <i>Home</i>, while Julia had been used to calling Ted Andrews "Uncle Ted", her mother suggested it would be more appropriate to refer to her stepfather as "Pop", while her father remained "Dad" or "Daddy" to her. Julia disliked this change.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Andrews family was "very poor and we lived in a bad slum area of London," Andrews recalled, adding, "That was a very black period in my life." In addition, according to Andrews's 2008 memoir, her stepfather was an alcoholic. Ted Andrews twice, while drunk, tried to get into bed with his stepdaughter, resulting in Andrews putting a lock on her door. But, as the stage career of Ted and Barbara Andrews improved, they were able to afford to move to better surroundings, first to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beckenham" title="Beckenham">Beckenham</a> and then, as the war ended, back to the Andrews's home town of Walton-on-Thames. The Andrews family took up residence at The Old Meuse, a house where Andrews's maternal grandmother happened to have served as a maid.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julie Andrews' stepfather sponsored lessons for her, first at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone-Ripman_School" title="Cone-Ripman School">Cone-Ripman School</a>, an independent arts educational school in London, then with the famous concert soprano and voice instructor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilian_Stiles-Allen" title="Lilian Stiles-Allen">Lilian Stiles-Allen</a>. "She had an enormous influence on me", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, "She was my third motherÂ â€“ I've got more mothers and fathers than anyone in the world." In her 2008 autobiography <i>Home</i>, Andrews denies having <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_pitch" title="Perfect pitch">perfect pitch</a>. After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Woodbrook_School_(Beckenham,_UK)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Woodbrook School (Beckenham, UK) (page does not exist)">Woodbrook School</a>, a local state school in Beckenham.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julie Andrews performed spontaneously and unbilled on stage with her parents for about two years beginning in 1945. "Then came the day when I was told I must go to bed in the afternoon because I was going to be allowed to sing with Mummy and Pop in the evening," Andrews explained. She would stand on a beer crate to reach the microphone and sing, sometimes a solo or as a duet with her stepfather, while her mother played piano. "It must have been ghastly, but it seemed to go down all right."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julie Andrews got her big break when her stepfather introduced her to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Val_Parnell" title="Val Parnell">Val Parnell</a>, whose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Empires" title="Moss Empires">Moss Empires</a> controlled prominent venues in London. Andrews made her professional solo debut at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Hippodrome" title="London Hippodrome">London Hippodrome</a> singing the difficult aria "Je Suis Titania" from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mignon" title="Mignon">Mignon</a></i> as part of a musical revue called "Starlight Roof" on 22 October 1947. She played the Hippodrome for one year. Andrews recalled "Starlight Roof" saying, "There was this wonderful American entertainer and comedian, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wally_Boag" title="Wally Boag">Wally Boag</a>, who made balloon animals. He would say, 'Is there any little girl or boy in the audience who would like one of these?' And I would rush up onstage and say, 'I'd like one, please.' And then he would chat to me and I'd tell him I sang... I was fortunate in that I absolutely stopped the show cold. I mean, the audience went crazy."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 1 November 1948, Julie Andrews became the youngest solo performer ever to be seen in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Variety_Performance" title="Royal Variety Performance">Royal Command Variety Performance</a>, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Palladium" title="London Palladium">London Palladium</a>, where she performed along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Kaye" title="Danny Kaye">Danny Kaye</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Brothers" title="Nicholas Brothers">Nicholas Brothers</a> and the comedy team <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_and_Bert_Bernard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="George and Bert Bernard (page does not exist)">George and Bert Bernard</a> for members of King George VI's family.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Julie Andrews followed her parents into radio and television. She reportedly made her television debut on the BBC program <i>RadiOlympia Showtime</i> on 8 October 1949. She garnered considerable fame throughout the United Kingdom for her work on the BBC radio comedy show <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Educating_Archie" title="Educating Archie">Educating Archie</a></i>; she was a cast member from 1950 to 1952.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andrews appeared on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_Theatre" title="West End Theatre">West End Theatre</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Casino" title="London Casino">London Casino</a>, where she played one year each as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Badroulbadour" title="Princess Badroulbadour">Princess Badroulbadour</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aladdin_(musical)" title="Aladdin (musical)">Aladdin</a></i> and the egg in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpty_Dumpty" title="Humpty Dumpty">Humpty Dumpty</a></i>. She also appeared on provincial stages across United Kingdom in <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> and <i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>, as well as starring as the lead role in <i>Cinderella</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1950 at the age of 14, Andrews was asked to sing at a party of a family friend, Katherine Norwalk, and it was then that she learned that Ted Wells was not her biological father.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 30 September 1954 on the eve of her 19th birthday, Julie Andrews made her Broadway debut portraying "Polly Browne" in the already highly successful London musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Friend" title="The Boy Friend">The Boy Friend</a></i>. To the critics, Andrews was the stand-out performer in the show. Near the end of her <i>Boy Friend</i> contract, Andrews was asked to audition for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Fair_Lady" title="My Fair Lady">My Fair Lady</a></i> on Broadway and got the part. In November 1955 Andrews was signed to appear with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> in what is regarded as the first made-for-television movie, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Tor" title="High Tor">High Tor</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andrews auditioned for a part in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rodgers" title="Richard Rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> musical <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Dream_(musical)" title="Pipe Dream (musical)">Pipe Dream</a></i>.

Rodgers was so impressed with Andrews's talent that concurrent with her run in <i>My Fair Lady</i> she was featured in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodgers_and_Hammerstein" title="Rodgers and Hammerstein">Rodgers and Hammerstein</a> television musical, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(TV)" title="Cinderella (TV)">Cinderella</a></i>. <i>Cinderella</i> was broadcast live on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> on 31 March 1957 under the musical direction of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Antonini" title="Alfredo Antonini">Alfredo Antonini</a> and attracted an estimated 107 million viewers.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1958 and 1962, Andrews appeared on such specials as CBS-TV's <i>The Fabulous Fifties</i> and NBC-TV's <i>The Broadway of Lerner &amp; Loewe</i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1960 Lerner and Loewe again cast her in a period musical as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinevere" title="Guinevere">Queen Guinevere</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_(musical)" title="Camelot (musical)">Camelot</a></i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a> and newcomer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Goulet" title="Robert Goulet">Robert Goulet</a>.

As Warner later recalled, the decision was easy, "In my business I have to know who brings people and their money to a movie theatre box office. Audrey Hepburn had never made a financial flop."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Andrews played the title role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Pictures" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Disney</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(film)" title="Mary Poppins (film)">Mary Poppins</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> had seen a performance of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelot_(musical)" title="Camelot (musical)">Camelot</a></i> and thought Andrews would be perfect for the role of the British nanny who is "practically perfect in every way!" Andrews initially declined because of pregnancy, but Disney politely insisted, saying, "We'll wait for you". Andrews and her husband headed back to the United Kingdom in September 1962 to await the birth of daughter Emma Katherine Walton, who was born in London two months later. The family returned to America in 1963 and Miss Andrews began the film.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of her performance in <i>Mary Poppins</i>, Andrews won the 1964 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> and the 1965 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award_for_Best_Actress_%E2%80%93_Motion_Picture_Musical_or_Comedy" title="Golden Globe Award for Best Actress â€“ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy">Golden Globe Award for Best ActressÂ â€“ Motion Picture Musical or Comedy</a>.

As a measure of "sweet revenge," as <i>Poppins</i> songwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Brothers" title="Sherman Brothers">Richard M.

Victoria Grant (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>), a struggling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soprano" title="Soprano">soprano</a>, is unable to find work. She bombs an audition at Chez Lui, a tawdry night club where Carroll "Toddy" Todd (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Preston_(actor)" title="Robert Preston (actor)">Robert Preston</a>) also works. That evening, Toddy starts a fight at Chez Lui after finding out that his boyfriend was dating a woman and is subsequently fired. Later that night Victoria runs into Toddy at a Paris <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restaurant" title="Restaurant">restaurant</a> where she is scheming to plant a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach" title="Cockroach">cockroach</a> in her food in order to get her meal for free, trying to foil the waiter (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Stark" title="Graham Stark">Graham Stark</a>). The plan goes awry after the cockroach goes missing and ends up on a woman's leg, starting a riot in the restaurant, which Victoria and Toddy use to escape. They spend the night at his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment" title="Apartment">apartment</a>. The next day, Toddy's boyfriend shows up to pick up his things and when he insults Toddy, Victoria breaks his nose and takes his spare clothes, as hers were ruined by the previous night's rain. At the sight of Victoria dressed as a man, Toddy hits upon a plan to help both her and himself: Victoria will pretend to be a man pretending to be a woman, and get a job as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen" title="Drag queen">female impersonator</a> in a nightclub. In order to enhance the ruse, Toddy will pretend to be her gay lover.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Soon Victoria's new persona, "Count Victor Grazinski", becomes the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_(honor)" title="Toast (honor)">toast</a> of Paris. As money and fame start to turn her (and Toddy's) lives around, an additional complication arises. King Marchand (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner" title="James Garner">James Garner</a>), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangster" title="Gangster">gangster</a> and nightclub-owner from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, finds himself at first attracted to Victoria and repelled by "Victor". This encourages his burly bodyguard, "Squash" Bernstein (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Karras" title="Alex Karras">Alex Karras</a>), to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out" title="Coming out">come out of the closet</a>, but it enrages Marchand's whiny-voiced, peroxide-blonde spitfire girlfriend Norma (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesley_Ann_Warren" title="Lesley Ann Warren">Lesley Ann Warren</a>).</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The vocal numbers in the film are presented as nightclub acts. However, the lyrics or situations of some of the songs are calculated to relate to the unfolding drama. Thus, the two staged numbers <i>Le Jazz Hot</i> and <i>The Shady Dame from Seville</i> help to present Victoria as a female impersonator. The latter number is later reinterpreted by Toddy for diversionary purposes in the plot, and the cozy relationship of Toddy and Victoria is promoted by the song <i>You and Me</i>, which is sung before the audience at the nightclub.</p>
