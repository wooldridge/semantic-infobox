      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Steven Allan Spielberg</b> (born December 18, 1946) is an American film director, screenwriter, film producer, video game designer and studio executive. In a career spanning four decades, Spielberg's films have covered many themes and genres. Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as an archetype of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing such issues as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust" title="The Holocaust">Holocaust</a>, slavery, war and terrorism. He is considered one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the founders of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> movie studio.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Academy Award for Best Director</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i> (1993) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i> (1998). Three of Spielberg's films; <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> (1975), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i> (1982), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (1993), achieved <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films" title="List of highest-grossing films">box office</a> records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5Â billion worldwide. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes" title="Forbes">Forbes</a> puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.0Â billion.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, to a Jewish family. His mother Leah Adler was a restaurateur and concert pianist, and father Arnold Spielberg was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. He spent his childhood in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haddon_Heights,_New_Jersey" title="Haddon Heights, New Jersey">Haddon Heights, New Jersey</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale,_Arizona" title="Scottsdale, Arizona">Scottsdale, Arizona</a>. Throughout his early teens, Spielberg made amateur 8Â mm "adventure" films with his friends, the first of which he shot at the Pinnacle Peak Patio restaurant in Scottsdale. He charged admission (25 cents) to his home films (which involved the wrecks he staged with his Lionel train set) while his sister sold popcorn.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, he became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouting_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Boy Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)">Boy Scout</a>, and fulfilled a requirement for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merit_badge_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Merit badge (Boy Scouts of America)">photography merit badge</a> by making a nine-minute 8Â mm film entitled <i>The Last Gunfight</i>. Spielberg recalled years later to a magazine interviewer, "My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started." At age 13, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled <i>Escape to Nowhere</i> which was based on a battle in east Africa. In 1963, at age 16, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firelight_(1964_film)" title="Firelight (1964 film)">Firelight</a></i> (which would later inspire <i>Close Encounters</i>). The film, which had a budget of US$500, was shown in his local cinema and generated a profit of $100. He also made several WWII films inspired by his father's war stories.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After his parents divorced, he moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga,_California" title="Saratoga, California">Saratoga, California</a> with his father. His three sisters and mother remained in Arizona, where he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder" title="Passover Seder">Passover Seders</a> at the home of Zalman and Pearl Segal on an annual basis. Although he attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_High_School_(Phoenix,_Arizona)" title="Arcadia High School (Phoenix, Arizona)">Arcadia High School</a> in Phoenix, Arizona for three years, Spielberg ended up graduating from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_High_School" title="Saratoga High School">Saratoga High School</a> in 1965. It was during this time Spielberg attained the rank of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Scout_(Boy_Scouts_of_America)" title="Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)">Eagle Scout</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg attended synagogue as a young boy in Haddon Heights, NJ, an area which did not allow Jews before World War II. He attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_L._Lewis" title="Albert L. Lewis">Albert L. Lewis</a>, who would later be memorialized as the main character in Mitch Albom's, <i>Have a Little Faith</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a child, Spielberg has faced difficulty assimilating. â€œIt isnâ€™t something I enjoy admitting,â€&#157; he once said, â€œbut when I was 7, 8, 9 years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parentsâ€™ Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times. My grandfather always wore a long black coat, black hat and long white beard. I was embarrassed to invite my friends over to the house, because he might be in a corner davening [praying], and I wouldnâ€™t know how to explain this to my WASP friends.â€&#157; Spielberg also said he suffered from acts of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Semitic" title="Anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> prejudice in his early life: he later said, "In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After moving to California, he applied to attend the film school at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> School of Theater, Film and Television three separate times, but was unsuccessful. He was a student subsequently of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University,_Long_Beach" title="California State University, Long Beach">California State University, Long Beach</a>. While attending Long Beach State in the 1960s, Spielberg became member of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_Chi_Fraternity" title="Theta Chi Fraternity">Theta Chi Fraternity</a>. His actual career began when he returned to Universal Studios as an unpaid, seven-day-a-week intern and guest of the editing department. After Spielberg became famous, USC awarded him an honorary degree in 1994, and in 1996 he became a trustee of the university. In 2002, thirty-five years after starting college, Spielberg finished his degree via independent projects at CSULB, and was awarded a B.A. in Film Production and Electronic Arts with an option in Film/Video Production.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As an intern and guest of Universal Studios, Spielberg made his first short film for theatrical release, the 24 minute film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin%27" title="Amblin'">Amblin'</a></i> (1968), the title of which Spielberg later took as the name of his production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblin_Entertainment" title="Amblin Entertainment">Amblin Entertainment</a>. After Sidney Sheinberg, then the vice-president of production for Universal's TV arm, saw the film, Spielberg became the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio (Universal). He dropped out of Long Beach State in 1969 to take up the television director contract at Universal Studios and began his career as a professional director. In 1969, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> announced that Spielberg would direct his first full length film, <i>Malcolm Winkler</i>, written by Claudia Salter, produced by John Orland, with Frank Price being the executive producer. However, because of the difficulty in casting the key male role, the film was not made. Steven Spielberg attended Brookdale Community College for undergrad.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first professional TV job came when he was hired to do one of the segments for the 1969 pilot episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Gallery" title="Night Gallery">Night Gallery</a></i>. The segment, "Eyes," starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, and she and Spielberg were reportedly close friends until her death. The episode is unusual in his body of work, in that the camerawork is more highly stylized than his later, more "mature" films. After this, and an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Welby,_M.D." title="Marcus Welby, M.D.">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a></i>, Spielberg got his first feature-length assignment: an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Game_(TV_series)" title="The Name of the Game (TV series)">The Name of the Game</a></i> called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L.A._2017" title="L.A. 2017">L.A. 2017</a>". This futuristic science fiction episode impressed Universal Studios and they signed him to a short contract. He did another segment on <i>Night Gallery</i> and did some work for shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Marshall:_Counselor_at_Law" title="Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law">Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law</a></i> and <i>The Psychiatrist</i> before landing the first series episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(TV_series)" title="Columbo (TV series)">Columbo</a></i> (previous episodes were actually TV films).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Matheson" title="Richard Matheson">Richard Matheson</a> adaptation called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_(1971_film)" title="Duel (1971 film)">Duel</a></i>. The film is about a psychotic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peterbilt_281" title="Peterbilt 281">Peterbilt 281</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanker_truck" title="Tanker truck">tanker truck</a> driver who chases a terrified driver (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Weaver" title="Dennis Weaver">Dennis Weaver</a>) of a small <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Valiant" title="Plymouth Valiant">Plymouth Valiant</a> and tries to run him off the road. <i>Duel</i> was his first feature film and major hit when it was released into theaters. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilys_Powell" title="Dilys Powell">Dilys Powell</a> was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_Evil" title="Something Evil">Something Evil</a></i>) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exorcist_(film)" title="The Exorcist (film)">The Exorcist</a></i>, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film length pilot of a show called <i>Savage</i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>. Spielberg's debut theatrical feature film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i>, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> stated that "a major new director is on the horizon." However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Studio producers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_D._Zanuck" title="Richard D. Zanuck">Richard D. Zanuck</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brown_(producer)" title="David Brown (producer)">David Brown</a> offered Spielberg the director's chair for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i>, a thriller-horror film based on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Benchley" title="Peter Benchley">Peter Benchley</a> novel about an enormous killer shark. Spielberg has often referred to the gruelling shoot as his professional crucible. Despite the film's ultimate, enormous success, it was nearly shut down due to delays and budget over-runs.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">But Spielberg persevered and finished the film. It was an enormous hit, winning three <b>Academy Awards</b> (for editing, original score and sound) and grossing $470,653,000 worldwide at the box office. It also set the domestic record for box office gross, leading to what the press described as "Jawsmania." <i>Jaws</i> made him a household name, as well as one of America's youngest multi-millionaires, and allowed Spielberg a great deal of autonomy for his future projects. It was nominated for Best Picture and featured Spielberg's first of three collaborations with actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dreyfuss" title="Richard Dreyfuss">Richard Dreyfuss</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rejecting offers to direct <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_2" title="Jaws 2">Jaws 2</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(1976_film)" title="King Kong (1976 film)">King Kong</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_(film)" title="Superman (film)">Superman</a></i>, Spielberg and actor Richard Dreyfuss re-convened to work on a film about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidentified_flying_object" title="Unidentified flying object">UFOs</a>, which became <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> (1977). One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, <i>Close Encounters</i> was a critical and box office hit, giving Spielberg his first Best Director nomination from the Academy as well as earning six other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> nominations. It won Oscars in two categories (Cinematography, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilmos_Zsigmond" title="Vilmos Zsigmond">Vilmos Zsigmond</a>, and a Special Achievement Award for Sound Effects Editing, Frank E. Warner). This second blockbuster helped to secure Spielberg's rise. His next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1941_(film)" title="1941 (film)">1941</a></i>, a big-budgeted World War II farce wasn't nearly as successful and though it grossed over $92.4Â million dollars worldwide (and did make a small profit for co-producing studios Columbia and Universal) it was seen as a disappointment, mainly with the critics. It has since become a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_film" title="Cult film">cult classic</a> thanks to television showings and home video releases.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg then revisited his <i>Close Encounters</i> project and, with financial backing from Columbia Pictures, released <i>Close Encounters: The Special Edition</i> in 1980. For this, Spielberg fixed some of the flaws he thought impeded the original 1977 version of the film and also, at the behest of Columbia, and as a condition of Spielberg revising the film, shot additional footage showing the audience the interior of the mothership seen at the end of the film (a decision Spielberg would later regret as he felt the interior of the mothership should have remained a mystery). Nevertheless, the re-release was a moderate success, while the 2001 DVD release of the film restored the original ending.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, Spielberg teamed with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> creator and friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Lucas" title="George Lucas">George Lucas</a> on an action adventure film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raiders_of_the_Lost_Ark" title="Raiders of the Lost Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a></i>, the first of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> films. The archaeologist and adventurer hero Indiana Jones was played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> (whom Lucas had previously cast in his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> films as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>). The film was considered a homage to the cliffhanger serials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Hollywood" title="Golden Age of Hollywood">Golden Age of Hollywood</a>. It became the biggest film at the box office in 1981, and the recipient of numerous Oscar nominations including Best Director (Spielberg's second nomination) and Best Picture (the second Spielberg film to be nominated for Best Picture). <i>Raiders</i> is still considered a landmark example of the action-adventure genre.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Spielberg returned to the science fiction genre with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>. It was the story of a young boy and the alien he befriends, who was accidentally left behind by his people and is trying to get back home. <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> went on to become the top-grossing film of all time. <i>E.T.</i> was also nominated for nine Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between 1982 and 1985, Spielberg produced three high-grossing films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poltergeist_(film)" title="Poltergeist (film)">Poltergeist</a></i> (for which he also co-wrote the screenplay), a big-screen adaptation of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">The Twilight Zone</a></i> (for which he directed the segment "Kick The Can"), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goonies" title="The Goonies">The Goonies</a></i> (Spielberg, executive producer, also wrote the story on which the screenplay was based).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His next directorial feature was the <i>Raiders</i> sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Temple_of_Doom" title="Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</a></i>. Teaming up once again with Lucas and Ford, the film was plagued with uncertainty for the material and script. This film and the Spielberg-produced <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> led to the creation of the PG-13 rating due to the high level of violence in films targeted at younger audiences. In spite of this, <i>Temple of Doom</i> is rated PG by the MPAA, even though it is the darkest and, possibly, most violent Indy film. Nonetheless, the film was still a huge blockbuster hit in 1984.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Spielberg's films often deal with several recurring themes. Most of his films deal with ordinary characters searching for or coming in contact with extraordinary beings or finding themselves in extraordinary circumstances. In an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">AFI</a> interview in August 2000 Spielberg commented on his interest in the possibility of extra terrestrial life and how it has influenced some of his films. Spielberg described himself as feeling like an alien during childhood, and his interest came from his father, a science fiction fan, and his opinion that aliens would not travel light years for conquest, but instead curiosity and sharing of knowledge.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A strong consistent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theme_(literature)" title="Theme (literature)">theme</a> in his family-friendly work is a childlike, even naÃ¯ve, sense of wonder and faith, as attested by works such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.T._the_Extra-Terrestrial" title="E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a></i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hook_(film)" title="Hook (film)"><i>Hook</i></a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.I._Artificial_Intelligence" title="A.I. Artificial Intelligence">A.I. Artificial Intelligence</a></i>. According to Warren Buckland, these themes are portrayed through the use of low height camera tracking shots, which have become one of Spielberg's directing trademarks. In the cases when his films include children (<i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_the_Sun_(film)" title="Empire of the Sun (film)">Empire of the Sun</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, etc.), this type of shot is more apparent, but it is also used in films like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)" title="Munich (film)">Munich</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saving_Private_Ryan" title="Saving Private Ryan">Saving Private Ryan</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminal" title="The Terminal">The Terminal</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amistad_(1997_film)" title="Amistad (1997 film)">Amistad</a></i>. If one views each of his films, one will see this shot utilized by the director, notably the water scenes in <i>Jaws</i> are filmed from the low-angle perspective of someone swimming. Another child oriented theme in Spielberg's films is that of loss of innocence and coming-of-age. In <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, Jim, a well-groomed and spoiled English youth, loses his innocence as he suffers through World War II China. Similarly, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> Frank naively and foolishly believes that he can reclaim his shattered family if he accumulates enough money to support them.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The most persistent theme throughout his films is tension in parent-child relationships. Parents (often fathers) are reluctant, absent or ignorant. Peter Banning in <i>Hook</i> starts off in the beginning of the film as a reluctant married-to-his-work parent who through the course of his film regains the respect of his children. The notable absence of Elliott's father in <i>E.T.</i>, is the most famous example of this theme. In <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i>, it is revealed that Indy has always had a very strained relationship with his father, who is a professor of medieval literature, as his father always seemed more interested in his work, specifically in his studies of the Holy Grail, than in his own son, although his father does not seem to realize or understand the negative effect that his aloof nature had on Indy (he even believes he was a good father in the sense that he taught his son "self reliance," which is not how Indy saw it). Even <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar_Schindler" title="Oskar Schindler">Oskar Schindler</a>, from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schindler%27s_List" title="Schindler's List">Schindler's List</a></i>, is reluctant to have a child with his wife. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich" title="Munich">Munich</a></i> depicts Avner as a man away from his wife and newborn daughter. There are of course exceptions; Brody in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_(film)" title="Jaws (film)">Jaws</a></i> is a committed family man, while John Anderton in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_Report_(film)" title="Minority Report (film)">Minority Report</a></i> is a shattered man after the disappearance of his son. This theme is arguably the most autobiographical aspect of Spielberg's films, since Spielberg himself was affected by his parents' divorce as a child and by the absence of his father. Furthermore to this theme, protagonists in his films often come from families with divorced parents, most notably <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (protagonist Elliot's mother is divorced) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Me_If_You_Can" title="Catch Me If You Can">Catch Me If You Can</a></i> (Frank Abagnale's mother and father split early on in the film). Little known also is Tim in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i> (early in the film another, secondary character mentions Tim and Lex's parents' divorce). The family often shown divided is often resolved in the ending as well. Following this theme of reluctant fathers and father figures, Tim looks to Dr. Alan Grant as a father figure. Initially, Dr. Grant is reluctant to return those paternal feelings to Tim. However, by the end of the film, he has changed, and the kids even fall asleep with their heads on his shoulders.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most of his films are generally optimistic in nature. Critics frequently accuse his films of being overly sentimental, though Spielberg feels it is fine as long as it is disguised. The influence comes from directors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In terms of casting and production itself, Spielberg has a known penchant for working with actors and production members from his previous films. For instance he has cast Richard Dreyfuss in several films: <i>Jaws</i>, <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i>, and <i>Always</i>. Aside from his role as Indiana Jones, Spielberg also cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a> as a headteacher in <i>E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</i> (though the scene was ultimately cut). Although Spielberg directed him only once (in Raiders of the Lost Ark, for which he voiced many of the animals), veteran voice actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Welker" title="Frank Welker">Frank Welker</a> has lent his voice in a number of productions Spielberg has executively produced from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins" title="Gremlins">Gremlins</a></i> to its sequel <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlins_2:_The_New_Batch" title="Gremlins 2: The New Batch">Gremlins 2: The New Batch</a></i>, as well as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Land_Before_Time" title="The Land Before Time">The Land Before Time</a></i> (and lending his voice to its sequels which Spielberg had no involvement in), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>, and television shows such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Toon_Adventures" title="Tiny Toon Adventures">Tiny Toons</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animaniacs" title="Animaniacs">Animaniacs</a></i>, and SeaQuest DSV. Recently Spielberg has used Tom Hanks on several occasions and has cast him in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i>, and <i>The Terminal</i>. Spielberg also has collaborated with Tom Cruise twice on <i>Minority Report</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i>. Spielberg has also cast Shia LaBeouf in four films: <i>Transformers</i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eagle_Eye" title="Eagle Eye">Eagle Eye</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Kingdom_of_the_Crystal_Skull" title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_Revenge_of_the_Fallen" title="Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></i>. Spielberg prefers working with production members with whom he has developed an existing working relationship.

Most of the DVDs of Spielberg's films have documentaries by Laurent Bouzereau.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A famous example of Spielberg working with the same professionals is his long time collaboration with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williams" title="John Williams">John Williams</a> and the use of his musical scores in all of his films since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sugarland_Express" title="The Sugarland Express">The Sugarland Express</a></i> (except <i>The Color Purple</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_Zone:_The_Movie" title="Twilight Zone: The Movie">Twilight Zone: The Movie</a></i>). One of Spielberg's trademarks is his use of music by John Williams to add to the visual impact of his scenes and to try and create a lasting picture and sound of the film in the memories of the film audience. These visual scenes often uses images of the sun (e.g. <i>Empire of the Sun</i>, <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, the final scene of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a></i>, and the end credits of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones_and_the_Last_Crusade" title="Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a></i> (where they ride into the sunset), of which the last two feature a Williams score at that end scene.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rodat first came up with the film's story in 1994 when he saw a monument dedicated to four sons of Agnes Allison of Port Carbon, Pennsylvania. The brothers were killed in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>.

The scene then cuts to the morning of June 6, 1944, the beginning of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Normandy" title="Invasion of Normandy">Normandy invasion</a>, with American soldiers preparing for the perils of landing on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach" title="Omaha Beach">Omaha Beach</a> and struggling against dug-in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heer_(1935-1945)" title="Heer (1935-1945)">German</a> infantry, machine gun nests, and artillery fire, which cut down many of the men. Captain John H. Miller, commanding officer of Charlie Company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_Ranger_Battalion_(United_States)" title="2nd Ranger Battalion (United States)">2nd Ranger Battalion</a>, survives the initial landing and assembles a group of soldiers to slowly penetrate the German defenses, leading to a breakout from the beach.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The scene then shifts to the United States where General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Marshall" title="George Marshall">George Marshall</a> is informed that three of four brothers in the Ryan family have all died within days of each other and that their mother will receive all three notices on the same day. He learns that the fourth son, Private First Class James Francis Ryan of Baker Company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/506th_Infantry_Regiment" title="506th Infantry Regiment">506th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division" title="101st Airborne Division">101st Airborne Division</a> is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">missing in action</a> somewhere in Normandy.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in France, three days after D-Day, Miller receives orders to find Ryan. He assembles six Rangers from his company, plus one Corporal Upham detailed from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/29th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)" title="29th Infantry Division (United States)">29th Infantry Division</a>, who speaks fluent French and German, to accomplish the task. With no information about Ryan's whereabouts, Miller and his men move out to Neuville. On the outskirts of Neuville they meet a platoon from the 101st. After entering the town, Private Caparzo is fatally wounded by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sniper" title="Sniper">sniper</a>, who is in turn shot and killed by Private Jackson. They locate a Private James Fredrick Ryan from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota" title="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> but soon realize their mistake. They find a member of Charlie Company, 506th, who informs them that his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_zone" title="Drop zone">drop zone</a> was at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vierville,_Manche" title="Vierville, Manche">Vierville</a> and that Baker and Charlie companies had the same rally point. Once they reach the rally point, Miller locates a friend of Ryan's, who reveals that Ryan is defending a strategically-important bridge over the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merderet" title="Merderet">Merderet River</a> in the fictional town of Ramelle.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the way to Ramelle, Miller decides to take the opportunity to neutralize a small German machine gun position close to an abandoned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar" title="Radar">radar</a> station, despite the misgivings of his men. Wade, their medic, is fatally wounded in the ensuing skirmish. The last surviving German, known only as "Steamboat Willie", incurs the wrath of all the squad members except Upham, who protests to Miller about letting the squad kill the German soldier. The German pleads for his life and Miller decides to let him walk away, blindfolded, and surrender himself to the next <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II" title="Allies of World War II">Allied</a> patrol. Viewing Miller's decision as letting the enemy go free, and no longer confident in Miller's leadership, Private Reiben declares his intention to desert the squad and the mission, prompting a confrontation with Sergeant Horvath. The argument heats up, until Miller defuses the situation by revealing his pre-war occupation as an English teacher, a question upon which the squad had set up a betting pool. Reiben then reluctantly decides to stay.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The squad finally arrives on the outskirts of Ramelle, where they help three paratroopers destroy a German <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halftrack" title="Halftrack">halftrack</a>. Among the paratroopers is Private Ryan. After entering Ramelle, Ryan is told of his brothers' deaths, and their mission to bring him home, and that two lives had been lost in the quest to find him. He is distressed at the loss of his brothers, but does not feel it is fair to go home, asking Miller to tell his mother "when you found me I was here, and I was with the only brothers I have left," looking at the small band whose duty it was to defend a bridge and destroy an approaching German mechanized unit. Miller decides to take command and defend the bridge, setting up a creative defense plan with what little manpower and resources available.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Germans arrive in force with more than 50 men supported by armor. In spite of inflicting heavy German casualties, most of the paratroopers, and Miller's squad (Jackson, Mellish and Horvath), are killed. While attempting to blow the bridge, Miller is shot and fatally wounded. Just before a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I" title="Tiger I">Tiger Tank</a> reaches the bridge, an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-51_Mustang" title="P-51 Mustang">P-51 Mustang</a> flies over and destroys it, followed by more Mustangs and advancing American infantry and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_Sherman" title="M4 Sherman">M4 Sherman</a> tanks who rout the remaining Germans. Upham <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution" title="Summary execution">executes</a> "Steamboat Willie" upon finding him with a group of surrendering Germans. Ryan, Reiben, and Upham are the only survivors of the battle. Ryan is with Miller as he dies and says his last words, "James... earn this. Earn it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in the present, the elderly veteran is revealed to be Ryan at Miller's grave. He asks his wife to confirm that he has led a good life and that he is a "good man," and thus worthy of the sacrifice of Miller and the others. He then salutes Miller's grave as the camera pans down the gravestones to a placid <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States" title="Flag of the United States">American flag</a> and fades out as it shows the number of men who died during fighting in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord" title="Operation Overlord">Normandy</a>.</p>

Beyond that, I've just always been interested in World War II. My earliest films, which I made when I was about 14 years old, were combat pictures that were set both on the ground and in the air.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Saving Private Ryan</i> has been critically noted for its realistic portrayal of World War II combat. In particular, the initial 24-minute sequence depicting the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_Landings" title="Normandy Landings">Omaha landings</a> was voted the "best battle scene of all time" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire</a></i> magazine and was ranked number one on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Guide" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a>'s</i> list of the "50 Greatest Movie Moments". The scene cost <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$" title="US$">US$</a>12 million and involved up to 1,500 extras, some of whom were members of the Irish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Defence_Forces" title="Reserve Defence Forces">Reserve Defence Forces</a>. Members of local reenactment groups such as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Battle_Group" title="Second Battle Group">Second Battle Group</a> were cast as extras to play German soldiers. In addition, twenty to thirty actual <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amputation" title="Amputation">amputees</a> were used to portray US soldiers maimed during the landing. Spielberg did not <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard" title="Storyboard">storyboard</a> the sequence, as he wanted spontaneous reactions and for "the action to inspire me as to where to put the camera".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The landing craft used included twelve actual World War II examples. The film-makers used underwater cameras to better depict soldiers being hit by bullets in the water. Forty barrels of fake blood were used to simulate the effect of blood in the seawater. This degree of realism was more difficult to achieve when depicting World War II German armored vehicles, as few examples survive in operating condition. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_I" title="Tiger I">Tiger I</a> tanks in the film were copies built on the chassis of old, but functional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-34" title="T-34">T-34 tanks</a>. The two vehicles described in the film as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer" title="Panzer">Panzers</a> were meant to portray <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marder_III" title="Marder III">Marder III</a> self-propelled guns. One was created for the film using the chassis of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a>-built <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panzer_38(t)" title="Panzer 38(t)">Panzer 38(t)</a> tank similar to the construction of the original Marder III; the other was a cosmetically-modified Swedish <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stridsvagn_m/41" title="Stridsvagn m/41">SAV m/43</a> assault gun, which also used the 38(t) chassis.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inevitably, some artistic license was taken by the filmmakers for the sake of drama. One of the most notable is the depiction of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2nd_SS_Panzer_Division_Das_Reich" title="2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich">2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich</a>, as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was not engaged in Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, one hundred miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/101st_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="101st Airborne Division (United States)">101st Airborne Division</a> but of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/82nd_Airborne_Division_(United_States)" title="82nd Airborne Division (United States)">82nd Airborne Division</a>, part of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Boston" title="Mission Boston">Mission Boston</a>. Much has been said about various "tactical errors" made by both the German and American forces in the film's climactic battle. Spielberg responded, saying that in many scenes he opted to replace sound military tactics and strict historical accuracy for dramatic effect.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To achieve a tone and quality that was true to the story as well as reflected the period in which it is set, Spielberg once again collaborated with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematography" title="Cinematography">cinematographer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janusz_Kami%C5%84ski" title="Janusz KamiÅ„ski">Janusz KamiÅ„ski</a>, saying, "Early on, we both knew that we did not want this to look like a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> extravaganza about World War II, but more like color newsreel footage from the 1940s, which is very desaturated and low-tech." KamiÅ„ski had the protective coating stripped from the camera lenses, making them closer to those used in the 1940s. He explains that "without the protective coating, the light goes in and starts bouncing around, which makes it slightly more diffused and a bit softer without being out of focus." The cinematographer completed the overall effect by putting the negative through <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleach_bypass" title="Bleach bypass">bleach bypass</a>, a process that reduces brightness and color saturation. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_disc_shutter" title="Rotary disc shutter">shutter</a> timing was set to 90 or 45 degrees for many of the battle sequences, as opposed to the standard of 180 degree timing. KamiÅ„ski clarifies, "In this way, we attained a certain staccato in the actors' movements and a certain crispness in the explosions, which makes them slightly more realistic."</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Release">Release</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was distributed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DreamWorks" title="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> in North America and by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> internationally. As a result of Paramount's 2005 acquisition of DreamWorks, Paramount has gained North America distribution rights as well (though still through the DreamWorks division). <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> was a critical and commercial success and is credited with contributing to a resurgence in America's interest in World War II. Old and new films, video games, and novels about the war enjoyed renewed popularity after its release. The film's use of desaturated colors, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand-held_camera" title="Hand-held camera">hand-held cameras</a>, and tight angles has profoundly influenced subsequent films and video games. <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> was released in 2,463 theatres on July 28, 1998, and grossed $30.5 million on its opening weekend. The film grossed $216.5 million in North America and $265.3 million on other territories, bringing its worldwide total to $481.8 million and making it the highest grossing domestic film of the year.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critical reception for the film was generally positive, with much praise for the realistic battle scenes and the actors' performances, but earning some criticism for the script and for ignoring the contributions of several other countries to the D-Day landings in general and at Omaha Beach specifically. The most direct example of the latter is that during the actual landing the 2nd Rangers disembarked from British ships and were taken to Omaha Beach by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a> landing craft (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_Craft_Assault#1944" title="Landing Craft Assault">LCAs</a>).

This criticism was far from universal with other critics recognizing the director's intent to make an "American" film. The film was not released in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia" title="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> after Spielberg refused to cut the violent scenes; however, the film was finally released there on DVD with an 18SG certificate much later in 2005. It currently scores 91% "Certified Fresh" on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and 90% on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, two film review aggregate sites. Many critics associations, such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards" title="New York Film Critics Circle Awards">New York Critics Circle</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Film_Critics_Association" title="Los Angeles Film Critics Association">Los Angeles Film Critics Association</a>, chose <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> as Film of the Year. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave it four stars out of four and called it "a powerful experience".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was later nominated for eleven <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, with wins for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography" title="Academy Award for Best Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Sound" title="Academy Award for Sound">Best Sound</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Sound_Editing" title="Academy Award for Sound Editing">Best Sound Editing</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Film_Editing" title="Academy Award for Film Editing">Best Editing</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a> for Spielberg, but lost the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a> award to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_in_Love" title="Shakespeare in Love">Shakespeare in Love</a></i>, being one of a few that have won the Best Director award without also winning Best Picture.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film debuted on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_video" title="Home video">home video</a> in May 1999 with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS" title="VHS">VHS</a> release that earned over $44 million. A later special edition, the D-Day 60th Anniversary Commemorative Edition, was released featuring an extra tape with documentary footage of the actual D-Day landings as well as the making of the film. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD" title="DVD">DVD</a> was released in November of the same year, and was one of the best-selling titles of the year, with over 1.5 million units sold.

The film was also issued in a very limited 2-disc <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laserdisc" title="Laserdisc">Laserdisc</a> release in November 1999, making it one of the very last feature films to ever be issued in this format, as Laserdiscs ceased manufacturing and distribution by the year's end, due in part to the growing popularity of DVDs. In 2004, a <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> special edition DVD was released to commemorate the 60th anniversary of D-Day. This two-disc edition was also included in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_set" title="Box set">box set</a> titled <i>World War II Collection</i>, along with two documentaries produced by Spielberg, <i>Price For Peace</i> (about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War" title="Pacific War">Pacific War</a>) and <i>Shooting War</i> (about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_photography" title="War photography">war photographers</a>, narrated by Tom Hanks).
