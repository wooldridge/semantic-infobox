As a girl, Turner lived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuela" title="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>, and she was living in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a> at the time that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" title="Fidel Castro">Fidel Castro</a> took over the government - and then the United States broke off <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_relations" title="Diplomatic relations">diplomatic relations</a> with Cuba, forcing the staff members of the American embassy in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a> to leave the country. Turner has two brothers and one sister. While attending high school in England, she was a gymnast, and she also took classes at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_School_of_Speech_and_Drama" title="Central School of Speech and Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In her early years, Turner was interested in performing. Her father did not encourage her: "My father was of missionary stock," she later explained, "so <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater" title="Theater">theater</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting" title="Acting">acting</a> were just one step up from being a streetwalker, you know? So when I was performing in school, he would drive my mom [there] and sit in the car. She'd come out at intermissions and tell him, 'She's doing very well.'"</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Kathleen graduated from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_School_in_London" title="American School in London">American School in London</a> in 1972. Her father died of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_thrombosis" title="Coronary thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> during that same year, and then his family members moved back to the United States. Kathleen attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Missouri_State_University" title="Southwest Missouri State University">Southwest Missouri State University</a> at Springfield for two years (where a fellow classmate was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Goodman" title="John Goodman">John Goodman</a>), then earned her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts" title="Bachelor of Fine Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> degree from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_Baltimore_County" title="University of Maryland, Baltimore County">University of Maryland in Baltimore County</a> in 1977.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1978, Turner made her television debut in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> daytime soap <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Doctors_(1963_TV_series)" title="The Doctors (1963 TV series)">The Doctors</a></i> as the second Nola Dancy Aldrich. She made her film debut in 1981 as the ruthless Matty Walker in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thriller</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_Heat" title="Body Heat">Body Heat</a></i>, a role which would bring her to international prominence. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_(magazine)" title="Empire (magazine)">Empire Magazine</a></i> cited the film in 1995 when it named her one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in Film History. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> wrote in 2005 that, propelled by her "jaw-dropping movie debut [in] <i>Body Heat</i>... she built a career on adventurousness and frank sexuality borne of robust physicality." Turner would ultimately become one of the top box office draws and most sought after actresses in the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The brazen quality of Turner's screen roles was reflected in her public life. With her deep voice, Turner was often compared to a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Bacall" title="Lauren Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, "Hi, I'm the young you." In the 1980s, she controversially boasted that "on a night when I feel really good about myself, I can walk into a room, and if a man doesn't look at me, he's probably gay."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>Body Heat</i>, Turner steered away from <i>femme fatale</i> roles to "prevent typecasting" and because the <i>femme fatale</i> roles had a "shelf-life". Consequently, her first project after this was 1983 comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_With_Two_Brains" title="The Man With Two Brains">The Man With Two Brains</a></i>. Turner co-starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romancing_the_Stone" title="Romancing the Stone">Romancing the Stone</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Douglas" title="Michael Douglas">Michael Douglas</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_DeVito" title="Danny DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>. The film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote of her performance as writer Joan Wilder, "Turner knows how to use her dimples amusingly and how to dance like a woman who didnâ€™t know she could; her star performance is exhilarating." <i>Romancing the Stone</i> was a surprise hit: she won a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> for her role in the film and it became one of the top-ten-grossing movies of 1984. Turner teamed up again with Douglas and DeVito the following year for its sequel, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jewel_of_the_Nile" title="The Jewel of the Nile">The Jewel of the Nile</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several months before <i>Jewel</i>, Turner starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prizzi%27s_Honor" title="Prizzi's Honor">Prizzi's Honor</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>, winning a second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> award, and later starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Sue_Got_Married" title="Peggy Sue Got Married">Peggy Sue Got Married</a></i> which co-starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>. For <i>Peggy Sue</i>, she received a 1986 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for Best Actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1988's toon-noir <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i>, she was the speaking voice of cartoon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale" title="Femme fatale">femme fatale</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Rabbit" title="Jessica Rabbit">Jessica Rabbit</a>, intoning the famous line, "I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way." Her uncredited, sultry performance was acclaimed as "the kind of sexpot ball-breaker she was made for." (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Irving" title="Amy Irving">Amy Irving</a> provided Jessica Rabbit's singing voice in the scene in which the character first appears in the movie.) That same year she also appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switching_Channels" title="Switching Channels">Switching Channels</a></i>, which was a loose remake of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1940" title="1940">1940</a> hit film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Girl_Friday" title="His Girl Friday">His Girl Friday</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turner appeared in the 1986 song <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_(Falco_album)" title="Emotional (Falco album)">"The Kiss of Kathleen Turner"</a> by Austrian techno-pop singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falco_(musician)" title="Falco (musician)">Falco</a>. In 1989, Turner teamed up with Douglas and DeVito for a third time, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Roses" title="The War of the Roses">The War of the Roses</a></i>, this time as Douglas' disillusioned wife. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> praised the trio, saying that "Mr. Douglas and Ms. Turner have never been more comfortable a team ... each of them is at his or her comic best when being as awful as both are required to be here ... [Kathleen Turner is] evilly enchanting." In that film, Turner played a former gymnast, and, as in other roles, she did many of her own stunts. (She broke her nose filming 1991's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V.I._Warshawski_(film)" title="V.I. Warshawski (film)">V.I. Warshawski</a></i>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turner remained an A-list <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_star" title="Movie star">film star</a> leading lady until the early nineties when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a> seriously restricted her activities and her movie career went into rapid decline. She was diagnosed in 1992, after suffering "unbearable" pain for about a year. By the time she was diagnosed, she "could hardly turn her head or walk, and was told she would end up in a wheelchair".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the disease worsened and the medication greatly altered Turner's looks along with excess alcohol consumption that Turner said she used to kill her physical pain, her once promising film career as a leading lady took a nose dive and Turner was seen less and less in blockbustersâ€”though Turner has also blamed her age, stating "when I was forty the roles started slowing down, I started getting offers to play mothers and grandmothers..." She appeared in the low-budget <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Cards_(1993_film)" title="House of Cards (1993 film)">House of Cards</a></i>, experienced moderate success with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Waters_(filmmaker)" title="John Waters (filmmaker)">John Waters</a>' <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Mom" title="Serial Mom">Serial Mom</a></i>, and had supporting roles in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Simple_Wish" title="A Simple Wish">A Simple Wish</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Blonde" title="The Real Blonde">The Real Blonde</a></i>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola" title="Sofia Coppola">Sofia Coppola</a>'s acclaimed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virgin_Suicides_(film)" title="The Virgin Suicides (film)">The Virgin Suicides</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite drug therapy to help her condition, the disease progressed for about eight years. Then, thanks to newly available treatments, her arthritis went into <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remission_(medicine)" title="Remission (medicine)">remission</a>. She was seen increasingly on television, including two episodes of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a></i>, where she appeared as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandler_Bing" title="Chandler Bing">Chandler Bing</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexualism" title="Transsexualism">transsexual</a> father.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, Turner performed a cameo in FX's acclaimed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nip/Tuck" title="Nip/Tuck">Nip/Tuck</a></i>, playing a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone_sex" title="Phone sex">phone sex</a> operator in need of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laryngitis" title="Laryngitis">laryngeal surgery</a>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In recent years, Turner has found renewed success on stage.

The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="British Broadcasting Corporation">BBC</a> reported that initially mediocre ticket sales for <i>The Graduate</i> <i>"went through the roof when it was announced that Turner, then aged 45, would appear naked on stage"</i>. While her performance as the infamous Mrs. Robinson was popular with audiences (with sustained high box office for the duration of Turner's run), she received mixed reviews from critics. The play transferred to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> in 2002 to similar critical reaction.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Turner married the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate" title="Real estate">real estate</a> entrepreneur Jay Weiss of New York City in 1984, and they produced one offspring, their daughter Rachel Ann Weiss who was born on October 14, 1987. Turner was born into a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methodist" title="Methodist">Methodist Christian</a> family, but she has said that she has "taken on a certain amount of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish" title="Jewish">Jewish</a> tradition and identity" since marrying her Jewish husband and raising their daughter in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiasm" title="Judiasm">Judiasm</a>. In 2006, Turner announced that she and Weiss were planning a trial separation. Ms. Turner and Mr. Weiss carried this forward to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorce</a> that became official in December 2007, but Ms. Turner has said, "[Jay]'s still my best friend".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By the late 1980s, Turner had acquired a reputation for being difficult: what <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> called "a certifiable diva". She admitted that she had developed into "not a very kind person", and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actress" title="Actress">actress</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Atkins" title="Eileen Atkins">Eileen Atkins</a> referred to her as "an amazing nightmare". Turner slammed Hollywood over the disparate treatment accorded actors over female actors in the quality of roles they receive as they age, calling it a "terrible double standard".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a result of her altered looks and weight gain from her arthritis treatment, <i>The New York Times</i> published this statement in 2005, "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick". Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">rheumatoid arthritis</a>. Turner has admitted that owing to her illness she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result the people she was closest to would suffer from it as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Graduate" title="The Graduate">The Graduate</a></i> in November 2002, Ms. Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospitial in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverly,_PA" title="Waverly, PA">Waverly, Pa.</a> for the treatment of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">drinking too much alcohol</a>. "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working", Ms. Turner explained: "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking ... I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think I was losing my control over it. So it pulled me back."</p>

The film was written by husband and wife team Jerry Leichtling and Arlene Sarner.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was nominated for three <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Best Actress</a> (Turner), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Cinematography" title="Academy Award for Best Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Costume_Design" title="Academy Award for Costume Design">Best Costume Design</a>.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy Sue Bodell (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Turner" title="Kathleen Turner">Kathleen Turner</a>) sets off for her 25-year high school reunion, albeit hesitantly, with her daughter, Beth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hunt" title="Helen Hunt">Helen Hunt</a>), coming along as company. Peggy Sue has just separated from her former high school sweetheart, now husband, Charlie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>), and is wary of attending the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_reunion" title="Class reunion">reunion</a> because of everyone questioning her about the absence of Charlie; they have been married since she became pregnant at the end of high school.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy Sue arrives at the reunion and is happy to reconnect with her old friends, Maddy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Allen" title="Joan Allen">Joan Allen</a>) and Carol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Hicks" title="Catherine Hicks">Catherine Hicks</a>), and all start to comment on old high school memories and how times (and classmates) have changed. Charlie unexpectedly arrives at the reunion, causing an awkward scene with Peggy Sue ignoring him. The awkwardness is ended when the event MC announces the reunionâ€™s "king and queen." The king is Richard Norvik (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Miller_(actor)" title="Barry Miller (actor)">Barry Miller</a>), a former class geek turned multi-millionaire computer whiz. Peggy Sue is named the queen, but on arriving at the stage, she faints.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Peggy Sue awakens, she finds sheâ€™s gone back to the spring of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1960" title="1960">1960</a>, her senior year of high school, having passed out after donating blood. Peggy at first believes she died at the reunion, but then comes to accept that she has gone back in time. Sheâ€™s in shock to see old family members so young and to talk to relatives who have since died. She attends high school classes and meets with old (now-young) friends as well as their now-young boyfriends (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> in one of his earliest roles is among them). Peggy answers simple questions with adult responses. For example, when her mother asks if she and Charlie had a fight, she replies yes - but about "house payments," talking about their future divorce. She also makes a get-rich-quick reference of going to England to discover <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy is confused by this new/old world, but sheâ€™s fascinated to get to live high school all over again and say things she always wanted to say (such as telling off rude girls and informing an algebra teacher she knows, for a fact, that she will never need algebra in her life). She uses this opportunity to repair an estranged relationship with her younger sister, Nancy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofia_Coppola" title="Sofia Coppola">Sofia Coppola</a>). One thing Peggy is not happy about is that sheâ€™s still dating Charlie. She breaks up with him and has a one-night stand with Michael Fitzsimmons (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_J._O%27Connor_(actor)" title="Kevin J. O'Connor (actor)">Kevin J. O'Connor</a>) â€” the guy in school she always wished sheâ€™d slept with.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Peggy Sue soon sees that this Charlie (at 18 years) is not the same as the adulterous Charlie she left in 1985 - and Peggy starts to fall in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love" title="Love">love</a> with him all over again, though the relationship still has its problems. Meanwhile, she contacts the young (ever geeky) Richard and asks for his advice on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_travel" title="Time travel">time travel</a>. Her inquiries into time travel lead to her grandfather, who agrees to try a strange <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A9ance" title="SÃ©ance">sÃ©ance</a> ritual with his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_Lodge" title="Masonic Lodge">Masonic Lodge</a> buddies to send her forward in time.</p>
