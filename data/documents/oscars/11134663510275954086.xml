	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Arthur Hiller Penn</b> (September 27, 1922 â€“ September 28, 2010) was an American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">film director</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer" title="Film producer">producer</a> with a career as a theater director as well. Penn amassed a critically acclaimed body of work throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_years">Early years</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Penn was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania" title="Philadelphia, Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, the son of Sonia Greenberg, a nurse, and Harry Penn, a watchmaker. He was the younger brother of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Penn" title="Irving Penn">Irving Penn</a>, the successful fashion photographer. During the 1920s, he moved in with his mother after she divorced Penn's father. Some time after, he came back to his sickly father, leading him to run his father's watch repair shop. At 19 he was drafted into the army. Stationed in Britain, he became interested in theater. He started to direct and take part in shows being put on for the soldiers around England at the time. As Penn grew up, he further became interested in film, especially after he saw the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Welles" title="Orson Welles">Orson Welles</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane" title="Citizen Kane">Citizen Kane</a></i>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After making a name for himself as a director of quality television dramas, Penn made his feature debut with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Handed_Gun" title="The Left Handed Gun">The Left Handed Gun</a></i> (1958). A retelling of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_the_Kid" title="Billy the Kid">Billy the Kid</a> legend, it was distinguished by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a>'s sharp portrayal of the outlaw as a psychologically troubled youth (the role was originally intended for the archetypal portrayer of troubled teens, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dean" title="James Dean">James Dean</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Penn's second film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_Worker" title="The Miracle Worker">The Miracle Worker</a></i> (1962), the story of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Sullivan" title="Anne Sullivan">Anne Sullivan</a>'s struggle to teach the blind and deaf <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller" title="Helen Keller">Helen Keller</a> how to communicate. It garnered two Academy Awards for its leads <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Bancroft" title="Anne Bancroft">Anne Bancroft</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Duke" title="Patty Duke">Patty Duke</a>. Penn had directed the stage production, written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson_(playwright)" title="William Gibson (playwright)">William Gibson</a>, also starring Bancroft and Duke, and he had directed Bancroft's Broadway debut in playwright Gibson's first Broadway production, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_for_the_Seesaw" title="Two for the Seesaw">Two for the Seesaw</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1965 Penn directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_One" title="Mickey One">Mickey One</a></i>. Heavily influenced by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave" title="French New Wave">French New Wave</a>, it was the dreamlike story of a standup comedian (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>) on the run from sinister, ambiguous forces. In 2010, Penn commented: "You know, you could not have gone through the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_Two" title="World War Two">Second World War</a> with all that nonsense with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia" title="Russia">Russia</a> being an ally and then being the big black monster. It was an absurd time. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy" title="Joseph McCarthy">McCarthy</a> period was ridiculous and humiliating, deeply humiliating. When I finally did 'Mickey One', it was in repudiation of the kind of fear that overtook free people to the point where they were telling on each other and afraid to speak out. It just astonished me, really astonished me. I mean, I was a vet, so it was nothing like what we thought we were fighting for."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Penn's next film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chase_(1966_film)" title="The Chase (1966 film)">The Chase</a></i> (1966) a thriller following events in a small corrupt Southern town on the day an escaped convict, played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">Robert Redford</a>, returns. Although not a major success, <i>The Chase</i> nonetheless caught the mood of the turbulent times, a 'state of the nation' tale of racism, corruption and the violence endemic in American society.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Reuniting with Warren Beatty for the rural gangster film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde_(film)" title="Bonnie and Clyde (film)">Bonnie and Clyde</a></i> (1967), Penn once again showed that he had his finger on the pulse of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist" title="Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a>, perfectly catching the youthful disenchantment of the late '60s. Although set 30 years earlier, during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Depression</a>, it was very much in the spirit of the contemporaneous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterculture_of_the_1960s" title="Counterculture of the 1960s">"counter-culture"</a>. <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> went on to become a worldwide phenomenon, at the same time pushing the limits of acceptable screen violence with its bloody machine-gun climax (two years before <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Peckinpah" title="Sam Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a>â€™s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Bunch" title="The Wild Bunch">The Wild Bunch</a></i>). The film was strongly influenced by the French New Wave and itself went on to make a huge impression on a younger generation of filmmakers. Indeed, there was a strong resurgence in the â€œlove on the runâ€&#157; subgenre in the wake of <i>Bonnie and Clyde,</i> peaking with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badlands_(film)" title="Badlands (film)">Badlands</a></i> (1973; in which Penn received acknowledgement in the credits).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next came <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Restaurant_(film)" title="Alice's Restaurant (film)">Alice's Restaurant</a></i> (1969), based on a satirical <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad" title="Ballad">ballad</a> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlo_Guthrie" title="Arlo Guthrie">Arlo Guthrie</a>. His next film after this was a return to the western genre, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Big_Man" title="Little Big Man">Little Big Man</a></i> (1970), a "shaggy dog" account of the life of a white man (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a>) who gets adopted into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne" title="Cheyenne">Cheyenne</a> tribe.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1973 Penn provided a segment for a promotional film for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympics" title="Olympics">Olympics</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visions_of_Eight" title="Visions of Eight">Visions of Eight</a></i> along with several other major directors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Schlesinger" title="John Schlesinger">John Schlesinger</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo%C5%A1_Forman" title="MiloÅ¡ Forman">MiloÅ¡ Forman</a>. His next film was a paranoid thriller set in Los Angeles, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_Moves_(1975_film)" title="Night Moves (1975 film)">Night Moves</a></i> (1975) about a private detective (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>) on the trail of a runaway. Next came a comic western, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Missouri_Breaks" title="The Missouri Breaks">The Missouri Breaks</a></i> (1976), a ramshackle, eccentric story of a horse thief (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>) facing off with an eccentric bounty hunter (played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the 1980s, Penn's career began to lose its momentum with critics and audiences: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Friends_(film)" title="Four Friends (film)">Four Friends</a></i> (1981) was a traumatic look back at the Sixties, returning to the old themes of Vietnam, civil rights, sexual politics, and drugs. Next came <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_(1985_film)" title="Target (1985 film)">Target</a></i> (1985) was a mainstream thriller reuniting the director with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_of_Winter" title="Dead of Winter">Dead of Winter</a></i> (1987) was a horror/thriller in the style of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, Penn returned to work in television, including an executive producer role for the crime series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout the years, Penn had maintained an affiliation with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University" title="Yale University">Yale University</a>, occasionally teaching classes there.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> is considered a landmark film, and is regarded as one of the first films of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hollywood" title="New Hollywood">New Hollywood</a> era, in that it broke many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taboo" title="Taboo">taboos</a> and was popular with the younger generation. Its success motivated other filmmakers to be more forward about presenting sex and violence in their films.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> received <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> for "Best Supporting Actress" (Estelle Parsons) and "Best Cinematography" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnett_Guffey" title="Burnett Guffey">Burnett Guffey</a>).

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the middle of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>, Clyde Barrow (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Beatty" title="Warren Beatty">Warren Beatty</a>) and Bonnie Parker (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Dunaway" title="Faye Dunaway">Faye Dunaway</a>) meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued with Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They do some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Pollard" title="Michael J. Pollard">Michael J.

The women dislike each other on first sight, and their feud only escalates from there: shrill Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde and C.W., while gun-moll Bonnie sees Blanche's flighty presence as a constant danger to the gang's well-being.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Bonnie and Clyde turn from pulling small-time heists to robbing banks. Their exploits also become more violent. When C.W. botches a bank robbery by parallel parking the getaway car, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face after he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hamer" title="Frank Hamer">Frank Hamer</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Pyle" title="Denver Pyle">Denver Pyle</a>), who is captured and humiliated by the outlaws, then set free. A raid catches the outlaws off guard, mortally wounding Buck with a gruesome shot to his head and injuring Blanche. Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. barely escape with their lives. With Blanche sightless and in police custody, Hamer tricks her into revealing the name of C.W. Moss, up till now still only an "unidentified suspect."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Ranger locates Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. hiding at the house of C.W.'s father Ivan Moss (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dub_Taylor" title="Dub Taylor">Dub Taylor</a>), who thinks the couple â€” and an ornate tattoo â€” have corrupted his son. He strikes a bargain with Hamer: in exchange for leniency for the boy, he helps set a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, the police in the bushes open fire and riddle their bodies with bullets in a bloodbath. The unblinking, real-time fusillade creates an iconic ending and "one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was intended as a romantic and comic version of the violent gangster films of the 1930s, updated with modern filmmaking techniques. Arthur Penn deliberately portrayed some of the violent scenes with a comic tone, sometimes even reminiscent of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Kops" title="Keystone Kops">Keystone Kops</a>-style <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slapstick" title="Slapstick">slapstick</a> films, then shifted disconcertingly into horrific and gory violence. The film was heavily influenced by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave" title="French New Wave">French New Wave</a> directors, both in its rapid shifts of tone, and in its choppy editing, which is particularly noticeable in the film's closing sequence.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was originally offered to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Truffaut" title="FranÃ§ois Truffaut">FranÃ§ois Truffaut</a>, the best-known director of the New Wave movement, who made contributions to the script, but eventually passed on the project to make <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fahrenheit_451_(1966_film)" title="Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)">Fahrenheit 451</a></i> instead. The producers approached <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Godard" title="Jean-Luc Godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a> next. Some sources claim Godard didn't trust Hollywood and refused; others allege he planned to change Bonnie and Clyde to teenagers and relocate the story to Japan, prompting the film's investors to force him off the project. After attending a screening of the completed film, Godard was asked what he thought of the film and reportedly replied, "Great! Now let's go make <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When Warren Beatty was on board as producer only, his sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_MacLaine" title="Shirley MacLaine">Shirley MacLaine</a> was a strong possibility to play Bonnie. But when Beatty decided to play Clyde himself, for obvious reasons he decided not to use MacLaine. Other actresses considered for the role were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Fonda" title="Jane Fonda">Jane Fonda</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuesday_Weld" title="Tuesday Weld">Tuesday Weld</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann-Margret" title="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Caron" title="Leslie Caron">Leslie Caron</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Lynley" title="Carol Lynley">Carol Lynley</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sue_Lyon" title="Sue Lyon">Sue Lyon</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cher" title="Cher">Cher</a> auditioned for the part, while Warren Beatty begged <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Wood" title="Natalie Wood">Natalie Wood</a> to play the role. Wood declined the role to concentrate more on her therapy at the time, and acknowledged that working with Beatty before was "difficult."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is forthright in its handling of sexuality. When Clyde brandishes his gun to display his manhood, Bonnie suggestively strokes the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallic_symbol" title="Phallic symbol">phallic symbol</a>. Like the 1950 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_Crazy" title="Gun Crazy">Gun Crazy</a>,</i> <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> portrays crime as alluring and intertwined with sex. Because Clyde is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impotent" title="Impotent">impotent</a>, his further attempts to physically woo Bonnie are frustrating and anti-climactic.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> was one of the first films to feature extensive use of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squib_(explosive)" title="Squib (explosive)">squibs</a> â€” small explosive charges, often mounted with bags of fake blood, that are detonated inside an actor's clothes to simulate bullet hits.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The family gathering scene was filmed in Red Oak, Texas. Several local residents were watching the film being shot, when the filmmakers noticed Mabel Cavitt, a local school teacher, among the people gathered, who was then chosen to play Bonnie Parker's mother.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film considerably simplifies the facts about <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonnie_and_Clyde" title="Bonnie and Clyde">Bonnie and Clyde</a>, which included other gang members, repeated jailings, other murders and a horrific auto accident which left Parker burned and a near invalid.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Gene Wilder-Evans Evans sequence is based on the kidnapping of real-life undertaker H.D.

In 1968, Hamer's widow and son sued the movie producers for defamation of character over his portrayal and were awarded an out of court settlement in 1971.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The only two members of the actual Barrow Gang who were still alive at the time of the film's release were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Barrow" title="Blanche Barrow">Blanche Barrow</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Jones" title="W.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1968, W.D. Jones outlined his period with the Barrows in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_(magazine)" title="Playboy (magazine)"><i>Playboy</i> magazine</a> article. In that same year he filed a lawsuit against Warner Brothers-Seven Arts, claiming that the film <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> "maligned and brought shame and disrepute" on him and damaged his character by implying that he was complicit in the betrayal of his old partners; he repeated the claim he made upon his arrest in 1933, that far from being a willing member of the gang he had actually tried to escape several times. There is no record that the petition was ever heard.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The poem that Bonnie Parker is reading as the police raid their Joplin hideout is â€œThe Story of 'Suicide Sal',â€&#157; one of only three poems by the real Bonnie Parker known to exist. The others are â€œThe Street Girlâ€&#157; and â€œThe Trailâ€™s End,â€&#157; also known as â€œThe Story of Bonnie and Clyde,â€&#157; which she is shown reading aloud later in the film.</p>

The movie then went on to gross over $70 million worldwide by 1973.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was controversial on its original release for its supposed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aestheticization_of_violence" title="Aestheticization of violence">glorification of murderers</a>, and for its level of graphic violence and gore, which was unprecedented at the time. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> was so appalled that he began to campaign against the increasing brutality of American films.
