As a young man, Johnson was a ranch hand and travelled with his father on the rodeo circuit. He was a star in rodeo before becoming involved in the movies. He was the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Rodeo_Cowboys_Association" title="Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association">Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association</a>'s Team Roping World Champion in 1953.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Johnson married Carol Elaine Jones in 1941, and they were married for 53 years until her death on March 27, 1994. The couple had no children. Carol Jones was the daughter of noted Hollywood horse wrangler Clarence "Fat" Jones.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His career began with the controversial <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outlaw" title="The Outlaw">The Outlaw</a></i>. (Hughes cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Russell" title="Jane Russell">Jane Russell</a> in the lead and had numerous camera shots of her ample cleavage, getting the attention of the Hollywood censors. The film was shot in 1940-41 but took years to get to selected theaters.) Before filming began, Hughes bought some horses at the Oklahoma ranch that Johnson's father managed, and hired Johnson to get the horses to northern Arizona (for The Outlaw's location shooting), and then to take them on to Hollywood.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Johnson liked to say later that he got to Hollywood in a carload of horses. With his experience wrangling for Hughes during <i>The Outlaw'</i>s location shooting, once in Hollywood he did stunt work for the 1939 movie <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fighting_Gringo_(1939_film)" title="The Fighting Gringo (1939 film)"><i>The Fighting Gringo</i></a>, and throughout the 1940s he found work <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrangler_(profession)" title="Wrangler (profession)">wrangling horses</a> and doing stunt work involving horses.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His work as a stunt man caught the eye of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>. Ford hired Johnson for stunt work in the 1948 film <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Apache_(film)" title="Fort Apache (film)"><i>Fort Apache</i></a>, and as the riding double for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>. During shooting, the horses pulling a wagon with three men in it stampeded. Johnson, who "happened to be settin' on a horse", stopped the runaway wagon, and saved the men. When Ford promised that he would be rewarded, Johnson hoped it would be with another doubling job, or maybe a small speaking role. Instead he received a seven-year acting contract from Ford. Ford called Johnson into his office, handed him an envelope with the contract in it. Johnson started reading it and when he got to the fifth line and it said "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">$</a>5,000 a week," he stopped reading, grabbed a pen and signed it, and gave it back to Ford.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His first credited role was in Ford's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Godfathers" title="3 Godfathers">3 Godfathers</a></i>, and Ford then suggested him for a starring role in the 1949 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Joe_Young_(1949_film)" title="Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)">Mighty Joe Young</a></i>; he played 'Gregg', opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Moore_(actress)" title="Terry Moore (actress)">Terry Moore</a>.

In 1950, Ford also cast Johnson as the lead in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_Master" title="Wagon Master">Wagon Master</a></i> (1950), a small film that was one of Ford's favorites.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Johnson played in supporting roles in the screen classics <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shane_(film)" title="Shane (film)"><i>Shane</i></a> (1953) starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Ladd" title="Alan Ladd">Alan Ladd</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Eyed_Jacks" title="One-Eyed Jacks">One-Eyed Jacks</a></i> (1961) starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>.

Duane is good-looking, amusing, and popular, and is dating Jacy Farrow (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybill_Shepherd" title="Cybill Shepherd">Cybill Shepherd</a>), the prettiest (and wealthiest) girl in town. Sonny is sensitive and caring, with a dumpy, unpleasant girlfriend, Charlene Duggs (Sharon Taggart), whom he does not love; she shares his indifference, and they decide to call it quits.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At Christmastime, Sonny stumbles into an affair with Ruth Popper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloris_Leachman" title="Cloris Leachman">Cloris Leachman</a>), the depressed middle-aged wife of his high-school basketball coach, Coach Popper (Bill Thurman). At the sad little town Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by unsavory Lester Marlow (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Quaid" title="Randy Quaid">Randy Quaid</a>) to a naked indoor pool party at the home of Bobby Sheen (Gary Brockette), a boy with wealthy parents, who seems to offer better prospects than Duane. The trouble is that Bobby is not interested in her as long as she is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin" title="Virgin">virgin</a>, so she has to get someone to deflower her first. Duane and Sonny go on a road trip to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a> â€” which happens entirely off-screen â€” and return to discover that Sam the Lion (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(actor)" title="Ben Johnson (actor)">Ben Johnson</a>), their mentor and father-figure in town, has died, leaving a will that bequeaths the town's movie theater to the woman who ran the concession stand, the cafÃ© to its waitress, Genevieve (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Brennan" title="Eileen Brennan">Eileen Brennan</a>), and the pool hall to Sonny.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jacy invites Duane to a motel for what he imagines is some lovemaking, but he is unable to perform; it takes a second attempt to alter her virginity status.

When Jacy hears of Sonny's affair with Ruth, she sets her sights on him and Ruth gets cut out very quickly. Sonny gets injured with a broken bottle in a fight with Duane, who still considers Jacy "his" girl. Jacy pretends to be impressed that Sonny would fight over her and suggests they elope. On their way to their honeymoon, they are stopped by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma" title="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> state troopers â€” it turns out that Jacy left a note telling her parents all about their plan. The couple is fetched back to Anarene by her father and mother (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Burstyn" title="Ellen Burstyn">Ellen Burstyn</a>) â€” in separate automobiles. On the trip back, Lois Farrow admits to Sonny she was Sam the Lion's erstwhile paramour and tells him he was much better off with Ruth Popper than with Jacy.</p>

Sonny flees back to Ruth, whom he has been ignoring since Jacy stole him away months earlier.

	<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(actor)" title="Ben Johnson (actor)">Ben Johnson</a> as Sam the Lion, the owner of the town's cafÃ©, movie theater, and pool hall. According to Bogdanovich, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Ritter" title="Tex Ritter">Tex Ritter</a> was almost cast in the role (he was introduced to Bogdanovich by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ritter" title="John Ritter">John Ritter</a>, who was being considered for the part of Sonny. However, Bogdanovich had his heart set on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Johnson_(actor)" title="Ben Johnson (actor)">Ben Johnson</a>. Johnson was not keen on the part because of the wordiness of the script; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Brennan" title="Eileen Brennan">Eileen Brennan</a> recalled that he hated to talk, saying he would rather ride his horse a "thousand miles than say any of these God damn words." Since Johnson had been discovered by the director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ford" title="John Ford">John Ford</a>, Bogdanovich called Ford, whom he knew well, having previously completed a documentary on him. Ford persuaded Johnson into the role by asking him "Do you want to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">the Duke</a>'s sidekick forever?" Johnson continued to find reasons not to do the film, and finally Bogdanovich told him, "You, in this role, are going to get an Academy Award," and finally Johnson accepted, "all right, I'll do the damn thing." Johnson did indeed win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> as Duane Jackson, one of the popular kids in the school, and who dates Jacy at the beginning of the picture. Bridges got the role because in the book he is not a particularly likeable character; Bogdanovich thought that Bridges's naturally fun personality would give the character extra depth and warmth, and make him less disagreeable.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Bottoms" title="Timothy Bottoms">Timothy Bottoms</a> as Sonny Crawford, Duane's buddy, who begins the picture with a girlfriend he does not like and ends up in an affair with Ruth. Bogdanovich liked Bottoms for his sad eyes, and recalled that he was convinced to cast him when he learned that he was being highly touted at the time by his agent who said he had been given the lead in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_Trumbo" title="Dalton Trumbo">Dalton Trumbo</a> movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Got_His_Gun" title="Johnny Got His Gun">Johnny Got His Gun</a></i> (1971); "I guess that's what convinced me" he said. Bottoms did indeed have the lead in <i>Johnny Got His Gun</i>, although he was playing a quadriplegic and terribly mutilated World War I soldier who could not see, hear, move or speak.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybill_Shepherd" title="Cybill Shepherd">Cybill Shepherd</a> as Jacy Farrow, a pretty and popular girl who learns about life through her experiments with sexual attraction. Shepherd was a model whom Bogdanovich spotted on the cover of an issue of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glamour_magazine" title="Glamour magazine">Glamour magazine</a> (probably June 1970). "There was something about her expression that was very piquant," he later said. He arranged to meet her with her agent in a hotel in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a>. She was, Bogdanovich says, interested in going through college and not particularly interested in being in movies, but she liked the script and thought it was an interesting part. She was playing with a rose on the table, and Bogdanovich kept expecting the rose to keel over and collapse; he recognised in that gesture the way Jacy Farrow plays with guys in the movie, and this convinced him that he had found Jacy. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Schneider" title="Bert Schneider">Bert Schneider</a>, the producer, found a screen test Shepherd had done with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Vadim" title="Roger Vadim">Roger Vadim</a> about a year before in which she was playing scenes from <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_on_a_Hot_Tin_Roof" title="Cat on a Hot Tin Roof">Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</a></i> with no sound, and dancing silently to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stones" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a> song. After filming had finished Bogdanovich admitted to Shepherd that the only time he ever doubted his decision was when he saw that screen test. Shepherd went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and read with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ritter" title="John Ritter">John Ritter</a>, and with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mitchum" title="Robert Mitchum">Robert Mitchum</a>'s son as well as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Bottoms" title="Timothy Bottoms">Timothy Bottoms</a>.</li>

Leachman wanted the role and Bogdanovich was impressed enough with her read-through to offer the part she wanted for a performance that ultimately earned her an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_Burstyn" title="Ellen Burstyn">Ellen Burstyn</a> as Lois Farrow, Jacy's mother, dated Sam in her younger days and has an off-and-on love affair with Abilene. Burstyn was asked to read for the part of the waitress but she liked the part of Lois Farrow and asked if she could read for that and ended up reading for all three parts, including Coach Popper's wife. Bogdanovich thought she would be good as any one of them and decided he wanted her in the picture for any role she selected. She chose to be Jacy's mother because she thought the part interesting.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eileen_Brennan" title="Eileen Brennan">Eileen Brennan</a> as Genevieve, the cafÃ© waitress, who inherits the cafÃ© after Sam dies. Bogdanovich had seen Brennan on the stage in a play called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Mary_Sunshine" title="Little Mary Sunshine">Little Mary Sunshine</a></i> in the 1960s and thought she had the perfect face for the waitress, Genevieve. When she read the script, Brennan thought it so powerful she wanted very much to be a part of the film and gladly accepted the role.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Quaid" title="Randy Quaid">Randy Quaid</a> as Lester Marlowe, an unsavory character. Quaid was asked to read for the part of Bobby, the rich kid from Wichita Falls, but Bogdanovich thought he would be better as Marlowe, so that was Quaid's debut role.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clu_Gulager" title="Clu Gulager">Clu Gulager</a> as Abilene, a man the same age as Sam, who sleeps with both Jacy and Lois. Bogdanovich's first choice was the country singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Dean" title="Jimmy Dean">Jimmy Dean</a>, but his producers did not like that idea; his next choice was Gulager, whom he had seen give a great performance in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegel" title="Don Siegel">Don Siegel</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers_(1964_film)" title="The Killers (1964 film)">The Killers</a></i> (1964). Gulager played hitman Lee with what Bogdanovich described as, "good regional quality."</li>
	  <li>Bill Thurman as Coach Popper, the high school's athletic coach and Ruth Popper's husband; it is implied that he is homosexual, and he is confirmed as such in the director's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_commentary" title="Audio commentary">commentary</a>.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Marshall_(film_producer)" title="Frank Marshall (film producer)">Frank Marshall</a> as Tommy Logan, a high school student. Marshall had been a production manager on Bogdanovich's earlier film, <i>Targets</i>, and they had such fun working together that Bogdanovich had promised him something on his next film. He came along as assistant production manager working with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Platt" title="Polly Platt">Polly Platt</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Location_scouting" title="Location scouting">location scouting</a> and played a small part as a high school student who is smacked on the backside by Coach Popper during recess. He shows up again later as a football player in a scene near the end.</li>
	  <li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Bottoms" title="Sam Bottoms">Sam Bottoms</a> as Billy the street-sweeper. Timothy Bottoms's younger brother Sam came along to stay with his brother for a few days as rehearsals started in Archer City. Seeing Sam sitting on some stairs, Bogdanovich asked him if he could act. Sam, who had appeared in productions of Santa Barbara Youth Theater since he was 10 years old, shrugged, and despite having previously cast the part to an actor from Dallas, Bogdanovich asked Sam to play Billy in the movie.</li>
	  <li>Sharon Taggart as Charlene Duggs, Sonny's dumpy, unpleasant girlfriend, at least in the first act.</li>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Bogdanovich" title="Peter Bogdanovich">Peter Bogdanovich</a> was a 31-year-old stage actor, film writer (by which is meant he wrote about film rather than writing films) and critic with two small films â€” <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targets" title="Targets">Targets</a></i> (1968) (also known as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Die" title="Before I Die">Before I Die</a></i>) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyage_to_the_Planet_of_Prehistoric_Women" title="Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women">Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women</a></i> (1968) â€” to his directorial credit when one day while waiting in line in a drugstore buying some toothpaste he happened to look at the rack of paperbacks and browsed the novels on display and picked up the one with what seemed to him to be an interesting title, <i>The Last Picture Show</i>. Reading the back of the book he learned it was "kids growing up in Texas," and decided that it did not interest him and put it back. A few weeks later the actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Mineo" title="Sal Mineo">Sal Mineo</a> handed Bogdanovich a copy of the book, "I always wanted to be in this," he said, "but I'm a little too old now," and recommended that Bogdanovich make it into a film. At the time Bogdanovich was married to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polly_Platt" title="Polly Platt">Polly Platt</a> and he asked her to read it, and her response was, "I don't know how you make it into a picture, but it's a good book." Bogdanovich, McMurtry and some sources suggest an uncredited Polly Platt went through the book and wrote a script which tells the story chronologically, always moving forward through time with no flashbacks or time slips, though there is one notable reminiscence.</p>

In writing about his home town he renamed it "Thalia" and in order to film "Thalia" Bogdanovich went back to Archer City.

When informed that the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Editors_Guild" title="Motion Picture Editors Guild">Motion Picture Editors Guild</a> required an editor credit, he suggested <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donn_Cambern" title="Donn Cambern">Donn Cambern</a> who had been editing another film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive,_He_Said" title="Drive, He Said">Drive, He Said</a></i> (1971) in the next office and had helped Bogdanovich with some purchasing paperwork concerning the film's opticals. Cambern disputes this, stating that Bogdanovich did do an edit of the film, which he screened for a selection of guests, including Jack Nicholson, Bob Rafelson and himself. The consensus was the film was going to be great but needed further editing to achieve its full potential. Bogdanovich invited Cambern to further edit the film, and Cambern made significant contributions to the film's final form.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1992, Boganovich re-edited the movie to create a "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director%27s_cut" title="Director's cut">director's cut</a>". This version restores nine minutes of footage that Bogdanovich left out of the 1971 release cut because <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia</a> imposed a firm 119-minute time limit on the film. With this requirement removed in the 1990s, Bogdanovich used the 127-minute cut on laserdisc, VHS and DVD releases. The original 1971 cut is not available on home video, though there are still extant 16mm and 35mm prints of it, mostly in collectors' hands.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">There are two substantial scenes restored in the director's cut, though neither is essential to the story. The first is a sex scene between Jacy and Abilene that plays in the poolhall after it has closed for the night; it precedes the exterior scene where he drops her off home and she says "Whoever would have thought <i>this</i> would happen?" The other major insertion is a scene that plays in Sam's cafÃ©, where Genevieve watches while an amiable Sonny and a revved-up Dwayne decide to take their road trip to Mexico; it precedes the exterior scene outside the poolhall when they tell Sam of their plans, the last time they will ever see him.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two scenes got slightly longer treatments: Ruth's and Sonny's return from the doctor, and the boys' returning Billy to Sam after his encounter with Jemmie Sue, both had added dialogue.
