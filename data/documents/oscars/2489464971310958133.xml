      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While <i>No Country for Old Men</i> is a "doggedly faithful" adaptation of McCarthy's 2005 novel and its themes, the film also revisits themes which the Coens had explored in their earlier movies <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Simple" title="Blood Simple">Blood Simple</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(film)" title="Fargo (film)">Fargo</a></i>.

The novel's motifs of chance, free-will, and predestination are familiar territory for the Coen brothers, who presented similar threads and tapestries of "fate [and] circumstance" in earlier works including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising_Arizona" title="Raising Arizona">Raising Arizona</a></i>, which featured another hitman, albeit less serious in tone. Numerous critics cited the importance of chance to both the novel and the film, focusing on Chigurh's fate-deciding <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin_flipping" title="Coin flipping">coin flipping</a>, but noted that the nature of the film medium made it difficult to include the "self-reflective qualities of McCarthy's novel."</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rudin" title="Scott Rudin">Scott Rudin</a> bought the book rights to McCarthy's novel and suggested a film adaptation to the Coen Brothers, who at the time were attempting to adapt the novel <i>To the White Sea</i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Dickey" title="James Dickey">James Dickey</a>. By August 2005, the Coen Brothers agreed to write and direct a film adaptation of <i>No Country for Old Men</i>, having identified with how the novel provided a sense of place and also how it played with genre conventions. Joel Coen said of the unconventional approach, "That was familiar, congenial to us; we're naturally attracted to subverting genre. We liked the fact that the bad guys never really meet the good guys, that McCarthy did not follow through on formula expectations." The Coens also identified the appeal of the novel to be its "pitiless quality." Ethan Coen explained, "That's a hallmark of the book, which has an unforgiving landscape and characters but is also about finding some kind of beauty without being sentimental." The adaptation was to be the second of McCarthy's work, following the 2000 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_the_Pretty_Horses_(film)" title="All the Pretty Horses (film)">All the Pretty Horses</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The brothers kept the script faithful to the book, only pruning the story where necessary. The script was so faithful to the novel that Ethan described the screenwriting process by saying, "[O]ne of us types into the computer while the other holds the spine of the book open flat." A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstory" title="Backstory">backstory</a> related to Bell were both removed. Also changed from the source material was Carla Jean Moss' reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As Kelly MacDonald explained to <i>CanMag</i>: "The ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's been through so much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it."</p>

Jones was the first actor to be officially cast in <i>No Country for Old Men</i>. The Coen Brothers felt that Jones fit the role since they wanted to avoid sentimentality and not have the audiences perceive the character to be a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Arquette#.22Charley_Weaver.22" title="Cliff Arquette">Charley Weaver</a> type. Praising Jones' credentials, the Coen brothers said, "He's from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Saba,_Texas" title="San Saba, Texas">San Saba, Texas</a>, not far from where the movie takes place. He's the real thing regarding that region." Joel Coen further outlined the directors' reasons for hiring Tommy Lee Jones in interview with Emanuel Levy:</p>

However, Brolin was initially overlooked for the role of Llewelyn. Other actors had been offered the role, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heath_Ledger" title="Heath Ledger">Heath Ledger</a>, who turned down the offer to take time off from acting. According to Brolin, the Coens' only response to the audition tape was, "Who <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_lighting" title="Stage lighting">lit</a> it?" Brolin said it was only due to his agents' persistence that he eventually got a callback:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Brolin broke his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collarbone" title="Collarbone">collarbone</a> in a motorcycle accident a few days before filming was due to begin, but he and his doctor lied about the extent of his injury to the Coens and they let him continue in the role.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Coens later wrote a short tongue-in-cheek piece for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)" title="Esquire (magazine)">Esquire</a></i> magazine called "Josh Brolin, the Casting Mistake of the Year," in which they claimed to have believed that they had cast <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Brolin" title="James Brolin">James Brolin</a> in the role of the aging <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" title="Vietnam War">Vietnam</a> vet, and upon realizing their mistake were forced to reset the movie in the year 1980, and attempted, unsuccessfully, to recast Tommy Lee Jones' role with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia_LaBeouf" title="Shia LaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a>.</p>

'Even Javier would come in by the end of the movie, rub his hands together and say, 'OK, who am I killing today?' adds Joel. 'It's fun to figure out', says Ethan. 'It's fun working out how to choreograph it, how to shoot it, how to engage audiences watching it.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Josh Brolin discussed the brothers' directing style in interview, saying that the Coens "Only really say what needs to be said. They don't sit there as directors and manipulate you and go into page after page to try to get you to a certain place. They may come in and say one word or two words, so that was nice to be around in order to feed the other thing. What should I do right now? I'll just watch Ethan go humming to himself and pacing. Maybe that's what I should do, too.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unusual for a thriller, the Coens worked against Hollywood convention and minimized the score used in the film, leaving large sections devoid of music. The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel to go with that idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carter_Burwell" title="Carter Burwell">Carter Burwell</a>, but after finding that "most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind [...] he used <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_bowls" title="Singing bowls">singing bowls</a>, standing metal bells traditionally employed in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" title="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> meditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed." The movie contains a "mere" 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called "Diabolic Clockwork" by Two Steps From Hell. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_Lievsay" title="Skip Lievsay">Skip Lievsay</a>, who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>No Country for Old Men</i> received highly positive reviews. As of October 4, 2010 the review aggregator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> recorded that 211 of 223 (95%) critics gave the film positive reviews, while another review aggregator, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, records an average score of 91%, based on 37 reviews. The film was widely discussed as a possible candidate for several Oscars, before going on to receive eight nominations, eventually winning four Academy Awards in 2008. Javier Bardem, in particular, has received considerable praise for his performance in the film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave the movie a four star review saying that it was "a masterful evocation of time, place, character, moral choices, immoral certainties, human nature and fate." Walter Chaw of <i>Film Freak Central</i> also praised the film as an effective adaptation of the source novel, declaring "the Coens have distilled the essence of McCarthy's gash-deep nostalgia for the illusory, ephemeral past... and packaged it in the very best moments of their own well of extraordinary visions." Two minority, dissenting voices were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Rosenbaum" title="Jonathan Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Reader" title="Chicago Reader">Chicago Reader</a></i>) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hunter" title="Stephen Hunter">Stephen Hunter</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i>). Rosenbaum gave it 1.5 out of 5 stars, saying while admiring the film's aesthetics, questioned its moral culpability: for him, the Coens expend great energy on depicting horror, while encouraging us to "hypocritically shake our heads at the sadness of it all." Hunter gave it 2.5 out of 5 stars and also acknowledged the Coens's film craft, but "just [didn't] like it very much": "Nobody goes to the movies for the irony. They go for the satisfaction."</p>

Stratton remarked "this magnificent film represents the best work the Coen Brothers have done since <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(film)" title="Fargo (film)">Fargo</a></i>. Like that movie classic, "this is a cold-blooded thriller with a darkly humorous edge" and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a> wouldn't have done the suspense better." Pomeranz said "it resonates within me.

Corliss praised Bardem's performance as "mesmerizing" and "astonishing," and the film as "dry, funny, beautifully acted, thrillingly cinematic." Corliss' fellow <i>Time</i> writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel" title="Richard Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> ranked the film #2 on his own Top 10 list, saying that the film returned the Coen brothers "to their best emotional territory of <i>Fargo</i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller%27s_Crossing" title="Miller's Crossing">Miller's Crossing</a></i>, a place where comic innocence and unmediated violence explosively coexist.
