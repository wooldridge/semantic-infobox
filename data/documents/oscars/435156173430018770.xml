			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">James Maitland Stewart was born on May 20, 1908
				in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana,_Pennsylvania" title="Indiana, Pennsylvania">Indiana, Pennsylvania</a>, the son of Elizabeth
				Ruth (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">née</a> Jackson) and Alexander Maitland
				Stewart, who owned a hardware store. Stewart's parents were <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_people" title="Scottish people">Scottish</a>
				<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presbyterian" title="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> origin. His Jackson ancestors served in
				the American Revolution, War of 1812 and the Civil War. The eldest of three children
				(he had two younger sisters, Virginia and Mary), he was expected to continue his
				father's business, which had been in the family for three generations.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His mother was an excellent pianist but his
				father discouraged Stewart's request for lessons. But when his father accepted a
				gift of an accordion from a guest, young Stewart quickly learned to play the
				instrument, which became a fixture off-stage during his acting career. As the family
				grew, music continued to be an important part of family life.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercersburg_Academy" title="Mercersburg Academy">Mercersburg Academy</a> prep school, graduating in
				1928. At Mercersburg, Stewart was active in a variety of activities. He played on
				the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football" title="Football">football</a> team and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_(track_and_field)" title="Athletics (track and field)">track</a> team. He was art editor for the
				KARUX yearbook and member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir" title="Choir">choir</a> club, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glee_(music)" title="Glee (music)">glee</a> club, and John Marshall Literary Society. During
				his first summer break, Stewart returned to Indiana Pennsylvania to work as a brick
				loader for a local construction company and on highway and road construction jobs
				where he painted lines on the roads. Over the following two summers, he took a job
				as an assistant with a professional magician. He also made his first appearance on
				the stage at Mercersburg, as Buquet in the play <i>The Wolves</i>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A shy child, Stewart spent much of his after
				school time in the basement working on model airplanes, mechanical drawing and
				chemistry — all with a dream of going into aviation. But he abandoned visions of
				being a pilot when his father insisted that instead of the Naval Academy he attend
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enrolled at Princeton in 1928 as a
				member of the Class of 1932. There, he excelled at studying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture" title="Architecture">architecture</a>, so impressing his professors with his thesis on an airport
				design that he was awarded a scholarship for graduate studies, but he gradually
				became attracted to the school's drama and music clubs, including the famous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Triangle_Club" title="Princeton Triangle Club">Princeton Triangle Club</a>. He was a member of
				the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_Charter_Club" title="Princeton Charter Club">Princeton Charter Club</a> as well as a head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleading" title="Cheerleading">cheerleader</a>. In his spare time, he enjoyed going to the

				just displacing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_films" title="Silent films">silent films</a>.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His acting and accordion talents at Princeton
				led him to be invited to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Players" title="University Players">University Players</a>, an intercollegiate summer
				stock company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Falmouth" title="West Falmouth">West
					Falmouth</a> a town on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This company had been organized
				in 1928 and would run until 1932, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Logan" title="Joshua Logan">Joshua
					Logan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretaigne_Windust" title="Bretaigne Windust">Bretaigne Windust</a>, and Charles Leatherbee as the directors. Stewart
				performed in bit parts in the Players' productions in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod" title="Cape Cod">Cape Cod</a>
				during the Summer of 1932 after he graduated. The troupe had previously included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>, who married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sullavan" title="Margaret Sullavan">Margaret Sullavan</a> on Christmas Day 1931 while the University Players were
				located in Baltimore for an 18-week winter season. Sullavan, who had rejoined the
				University Players in Baltimore in November 1931 at the close of the post-Broadway
				tour of <i>A Modern Virgin,</i> left the Players for good at the end of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trial_of_Mary_Dugan" title="The Trial of Mary Dugan">The Trial of Mary Dugan</a> in Baltimore in
				March 1932. By the time Stewart joined the University Players on Cape Cod after his
				graduation from Princeton in 1932, Fonda and Sullavan's brief marriage had ended.
				Stewart and Fonda became great friends over the summer of 1932 when they shared an
				apartment with Joshua Logan and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_McCormick" title="Myron McCormick">Myron McCormick</a>. When he came to New York at the end of the summer stock
				season, which had included the Broadway try-out of <i>Goodbye Again</i>, he shared
				an apartment with Henry Fonda, who had by then finalized his divorce from Sullavan.
				Along with fellow University Players, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Alfred_Dalrymple&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Alfred Dalrymple (page does not exist)">Alfred Dalrymple</a> and Myron
				McCormick, Stewart had his Broadway debut as a chauffeur in the comedy <i>Goodbye
					Again</i>, in which he had two lines. <i>The New Yorker</i> noted, "Mr. James
				Stewart's chauffeur... comes on for three minutes and walks off to a round of
				spontaneous applause."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The play was a moderate success, but times were
				hard. Many Broadway theaters had been converted to movie houses and the Depression
				was reaching bottom. "From 1932 through 1934," Stewart later recalled, "I'd only
				worked three months. Every play I got into folded." By 1934, he got more substantial
				stage roles, including the hit, <i>Page Miss Glory</i>, and his first dramatic stage
				role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Howard" title="Sidney Howard">Sidney Howard</a>'s <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Jack_(play_and_film)" title="Yellow Jack (play and film)">Yellow Jack</a>
				</i>, which convinced him to continue his acting career. However, Stewart and Fonda,
				still roommates, were both struggling.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the fall of 1934, Fonda's success in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer_Takes_a_Wife" title="The Farmer Takes a Wife">The Farmer Takes a Wife</a>
				</i> took him to Hollywood. Finally, Stewart attracted the interest of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> scout Bill Grady who saw Stewart on the
				opening night of <i>Divided by Three</i>, a glittering première with many luminaries
				in attendance including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Berlin" title="Irving Berlin">Irving
					Berlin</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moss_Hart" title="Moss Hart">Moss Hart</a> and his buddy Fonda who had returned to New York
				for the show. With Fonda's encouragement, Stewart agreed to take the screen test and
				signed a contract with MGM in April 1935, as a contract player for up to seven years
				at $350 a week.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On his arrival by train to Los Angeles, Fonda
				greeted Stewart at the station and took him to Fonda's studio-supplied lodging,
				right next door to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta
					Garbo</a>. His first job at the studio was as a participant in the screen tests
				done for newly arrived starlets. At first, he had trouble being cast in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> films due to his gangling looks and shy, humble screen presence.
				His first film was the poorly received <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer
					Tracy</a> vehicle, <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murder_Man" title="The Murder Man">The Murder Man</a>
				</i>, but <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_Marie_(operetta)" title="Rose Marie (operetta)">Rose Marie</a>
				</i>, an adaptation of a popular operetta, was more successful. After mixed success
				in films, he received his first substantial part in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_in_film" title="1936 in film">1936</a>'s
						<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_the_Thin_Man" title="After the Thin Man">After the Thin Man</a>.</i></p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the romantic front, he found himself dating
				newly-divorced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>, whom he had revered while a student at
				Princeton only a few years earlier. The romance soon cooled, however, and by chance
				Stewart encountered Margaret Sullavan again. Stewart found his footing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> thanks largely to Sullavan who campaigned for Stewart to be her
				leading man in the 1936 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romantic_comedy" title="Romantic comedy">romantic comedy</a>
				<i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Time_We_Love" title="Next Time We Love">Next Time We Love</a>
				</i>. She rehearsed extensively with him, having a noticeable effect on his
				confidence. She encouraged Stewart to feel comfortable with his unique mannerisms
				and boyish charm and use them naturally as his own style. In the meantime, roommate
				Fonda continued to arrange parties with starlets, who found Stewart different from
				the other young actors and irresistible in his own way. Stewart was enjoying
				Hollywood life and had no regrets about giving up the stage, as he worked six days a
				week in the MGM factory.In 1936, he acquired big-time agent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Hayward" title="Leland Hayward">Leland
					Hayward</a>, who would eventually marry Margaret Sullavan. Hayward started to
				chart Stewart's career, deciding the best path for him was through loan-outs to
				other studios.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1938, Stewart had a brief, tumultuous, and
				well-publicized romance with Hollywood queen <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma
					Shearer</a> whose husband <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>, head of production at MGM, had died two years earlier.
				Stewart began a successful partnership with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank
					Capra</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1938_in_film" title="1938 in film">1938</a>,
				when he was loaned out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> to star in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_Can%27t_Take_It_With_You_(film)" title="You Can't Take It With You (film)">You Can't Take It With You</a>
				</i>. Frank Capra had been impressed by Stewart's minor role in <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Blue_and_Gold" title="Navy Blue and Gold">Navy Blue and Gold</a>
				</i> (1937). The director had recently completed several popular movies including <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a>
				</i> and was looking for the right type of actor to suit his needs—which other
				recent actors in his films such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark
					Gable</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Colman" title="Ronald Colman">Ronald Colman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> did not quite fit. Not only was Stewart just what he was looking for,
				but Capra also found Stewart understood that prototype intuitively and required very
				little directing. Later Capra commented, "I think he's probably the best actor who's
				ever hit the screen."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This heart-warming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Depression" title="The Great Depression">Depression</a>-era film <i>(You Can't Take It With
					You)</i>, starring Capra's "favorite actress", comedienne <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean

					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Smith_Goes_to_Washington" title="Mr. Smith Goes to Washington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>
				</i>. Stewart replaced intended star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> in the film about an idealistic man thrown into the political arena.
				Upon the film's October release, it garnered critical praise and became a box office
				success. For his performance, Stewart was nominated for the first of five <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Best Actor</a>. Even after this great
				success, Stewart's parents were still trying to talk him into leaving Hollywood and
				its sinful ways and to return to his home town to lead a decent life. Instead, he
				took a secret trip to Europe to take a break and returned home just as Germany
				invaded Poland.</p>

				less well with the public. <i>Newsweek</i> wrote that they were "perfectly cast in

				distinctive voice on the "Lux Radio Hour," the "Screen Guild Theater" and other
				radio shows. So well known had his slow drawl become that comedians started to
				impersonate him, a form of flattery which continued for most of his life.</p>

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An early interest in flying led Stewart to

					accumulated over 400 hours of flying time.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Considered a highly proficient pilot, he

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart enlisted as a private and began

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Public appearances by Stewart were limited

					</i>, appeared nationwide beginning in late May and was very successful,
					resulting in 150,000 new recruits.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Stewart was concerned that his expertise and
					celebrity status would relegate him to instructor duties "behind the lines." His

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"Still, the war was moving on. For the
					36-year-old Stewart, combat duty seemed far away and unreachable and he had no
					clear plans for the future. But then a rumor that Stewart would be taken off
					flying status and assigned to making training films or selling bonds called for
					his immediate and decisive action, because what he dreaded most was the
					hope-shattering spectre of a dead end." Stewart appealed to his commander, a
					pre-war aviator, who understood the situation and reassigned him to a unit going
					overseas.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1943 he was finally assigned to
					the 445th Bombardment Group at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_Gateway_Airport" title="Sioux Gateway Airport">Sioux City AAB</a>, Iowa, first as Operations
					Officer of the 703rd Bombardment Squadron and then as its commander, at the rank

					Nazi-occupied Europe. These missions went <i>uncounted</i> at Stewart's orders.
					His "official" total is listed as 20 and is limited to those with the 445th. In
					1944, he twice received the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)" title="Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)">Distinguished Flying

				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the beginning of June 1945, Stewart was

					1959. Stewart did not often talk of his wartime service, perhaps due to his
					desire to be seen as a regular soldier doing his duty instead of as a celebrity.
					He did appear on the TV series, <i>
						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_At_War" title="The World At War">The World At War</a>

						<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Raid_on_Schweinfurt" title="Second Raid on Schweinfurt">Black Thursday</a>
					</i> due to the high casualties it sustained; in total, 60 aircraft were lost
					out of 291 dispatched, as the raid consisting entirely of B-17s was unescorted
					all the way to Schweinfurt and back due to the contemporary escort aircraft
					available lacking the range. Fittingly, he was identified only as "James
					Stewart, Squadron Commander" in the documentary.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He served as Air Force Reserve commander of

					<span class="mw-headline">Plot</span>
				</h2>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The governor of an unnamed state, Hubert
					"Happy" Hopper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kibbee" title="Guy Kibbee">Guy
						Kibbee</a>), has to pick a replacement for deceased <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senator</a> Sam Foley. His <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption" title="Political corruption">corrupt</a> political boss, Jim Taylor (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Arnold_(actor)" title="Edward Arnold (actor)">Edward Arnold</a>), pressures Hopper to choose
					his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer. The governor's
					children want him to select Jefferson Smith (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>), the head of the Boy
					Rangers. Unable to make up his mind, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it
					lands on its side – and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's
					accomplishments – he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will
					please the people while his naiveté will make him easy to manipulate.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smith is taken under the wing of the
					publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</a>), who was Smith's late father's oldest
					and best friend, and he develops an immediate attraction to the senator's
					daughter, Susan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Allwyn" title="Astrid Allwyn">Astrid Allwyn</a>). The unforgiving Washington press quickly labels Smith a
					bumpkin, with no business being a senator. Paine, to keep Smith busy, suggests
					he propose a bill.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smith comes up with legislation that would
					authorize a federal government loan to buy some land in his home state for a
					national boys' camp, to be paid back by youngsters across America. Donations
					pour in immediately. However, the proposed campsite is already part of a
					dam-building graft scheme included in a Public Works bill framed by the Taylor
					political machine and supported by Senator Paine.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unwilling to crucify the worshipful Smith so
					that their graft plan will go through, Paine tells Taylor he wants out, but
					Taylor reminds him that Paine is in power primarily through Taylor's influence.
					Through Paine, the machine accuses Smith of trying to profit from his bill by
					producing fraudulent evidence that Smith owns the land in question. Smith is too
					shocked by Paine's betrayal to defend himself, and runs away. However, his
					cynical aide and secretary, Clarissa Saunders (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean
						Arthur</a>), has come to believe in him, and talks him into launching a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster" title="Filibuster">filibuster</a> to postpone the Works bill and prove his
					innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. While Smith
					talks non-stop, his constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched
					opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. On Taylor's orders,
					newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state refuse to report what Smith
					has to say, and even twist the facts against him. An effort by the Boy Rangers
					to spread the news results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's
					minions.</p>
				<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although all hope seems lost, the senators
					begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last
					card up his sleeve. He brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home
					state from people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith
					finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate
						(<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Carey" title="Harry Carey">Harry Carey</a>). Smith vows to press on until people
					believe him, but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with guilt, Paine
					leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to kill himself. When he is stopped, he
					bursts back into the Senate chamber, loudly confesses to the whole scheme and
					affirms Smith's innocence.</p>

			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> originally purchased <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_R._Foster" title="Lewis R.

					Capra</a> came onboard as director – after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouben_Mamoulian" title="Rouben Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a> had expressed interest – the film was to be a sequel to
				his <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Deeds_Goes_to_Town" title="Mr. Deeds Goes to Town">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</a>
				</i>, called <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington</i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary
					Cooper</a> reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds. Because Cooper was
				unavailable, Capra then "saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean
				Arthur," and Stewart was borrowed from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a>. Capra said of
				Stewart: ""I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith ... He looked like the country
				kid, the idealist. It was very close to him."</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 1938, both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a> had submitted
				Foster's story to the censors at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Office" title="Hays Office">Hays
					Office</a>, probably indicating that both studios had interest in the project
				before Columbia purchased it. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_I._Breen" title="Joseph I. Breen">Joseph I. Breen</a>, the head of that office, warned the studios:</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Breen specifically objected to</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">and warned that the film should make clear
				that</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later, after the screenplay had been written and
				submitted, Breen reversed course, saying of the film that</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was in production from April 3 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_in_film" title="1939 in film">1939</a> to 7 July of that year. Some location shooting
				took place in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_DC" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Station_(Washington)" title="Union Station (Washington)">Union Station</a> and at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol" title="United States Capitol">United States Capitol</a>, as well as other
				locations for background use.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studio, to ensure authenticity, an
				elaborate set was created, consisting of Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms, hotel
				suites as well as specific Washington, DC monuments, all based on a trip Capra and
				his crew made to the capital. Even the Press Club of Washington was reproduced in
				minute detail, but the major effort went into a faithful reproduction of the Senate
				Chamber on the Columbia lot. James D. Preston, a former superintendent of the Senate
				gallery, acted as technical director for the Senate set, as well as advising on
				political protocol. The production also utilized the "New York street set" on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> lot, using a thousand extras when that
				scene was shot.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ending of the film was apparently changed at
				some point, as the original program describes Stewart and Arthur returning to Mr.
				Smith's hometown, where they are met by a big parade, with the implication that they
				are married and starting a family. In addition, the Taylor political machine was
				shown being crushed, Stewart visited Claude Rains, on a motorcycle, and forgiving
				him, and a visit to Smith's mother. Some of this footage can be seen in the film's
				trailer.</p>

				<span class="mw-headline">Impact</span>
			</h2>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it was first released – the film premiered
				in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Hall" title="Constitution Hall">Constitution Hall</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, on October 17, 1939, sponsored by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" title="National Press Club">National Press Club</a>, an event to which 4000
				guests were invited, including 45 Senators – <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> was
				attacked by the Washington press, and politicians in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress" title="U.S. Congress">U.S.
					Congress</a>, as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism" title="Anti-Americanism">anti-American</a> and pro-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communist</a>
				for its portrayal of corruption in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">American government</a>. While
				Capra claims in his autobiography that some Senators walked out of the premiere,
				contemporary press accounts are unclear about whether this occurred or not, or
				whether Senators yelled back at the screen during the film.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It <i>is</i> known that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alben_W._Barkley" title="Alben W. Barkley">Alben W. Barkley</a>, the Senate Majority Leader, called the film "silly and
				stupid," and said it "makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks." He also
				remarked that the film was "a grotesque distortion" of the Senate, "as grotesque as
				anything ever seen! Imagine the Vice President of the United States winking at a
				pretty girl in the gallery in order to encourage a filibuster!" Barkley thought the
				film "...showed the Senate as the biggest aggregation of nincompoops on record!"</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pete Harrison, a respected journalist, suggested
				that the Senate pass a bill allowing theatre owners to refuse to show films that
				"were not in the best interest of our country." That did not happen, but one of the
				ways that some Senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had
				done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the Neely
				Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned
				theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which
				put forward the film's patriotism and support of democracy, and publicized the
				film's many positive reviews.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other objections were voiced as well. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy" title="Joseph P. Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy</a>, the American Ambassador to
				Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a>
				to say that he feared the film would damage "America's prestige in Europe", and
				because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release. Capra and Cohn
				responded citing the film's review, which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he
				never followed up, although he privately still had doubts about the film.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was banned in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi
					Germany</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">Fascist</a>

				<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. According to Capra, the film was also <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" title="Dubbing (filmmaking)">dubbed</a> in certain European countries to alter
				the message of the film so it conformed with official ideology.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a ban on American films was imposed in
				German-occupied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_in_film" title="1942 in film">1942</a>,
				some theaters chose to show <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> as the last movie
				before the ban went into effect. One theater owner in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> reportedly
				screened the film nonstop for 30 days after the ban was announced.</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The critical response to the film was more
				measured that the reaction by politicians, domestic and foreign. The critic for the <i>
					<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a>
				</i>, for instance, Frank S. Nugent, wrote that</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> has been
				called one of the quintessential <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower" title="Whistleblower">whistleblower</a> films in American history. Dr. James Murtagh and Dr. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wigand" title="Jeffrey Wigand">Jeffrey Wigand</a> cited this film as a seminal event in
				U.S. history at the first "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower_Week_in_Washington" title="Whistleblower Week in Washington">Whistleblower Week in Washington</a>"
				(May 13-19, 2007).</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film has often been listed as among Capra's
				best, but it has been noted that it</p>
			<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, Smith's filibuster and the tacit
				encouragement of the Senate President are both emblematic of the director's belief
