      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One night, when Shug asks Celie about Nettie, Celie says that she believes her sister to be dead, since she had promised to write but Celie had never received any letters. Shug informs Celie that she has seen "Mr." hide numerous mysterious letters in a trunk and suggests that they investigate. When they do so, they find dozens of letters written by Nettie to Celie over the years. These tell of Nettie's travels to Africa with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionary" title="Missionary">missionary</a> couple, Samuel and Corrine, and their adopted children, Olivia and Adam. When Corrine becomes ill, Samuel tells Nettie how they came to adopt their children and that his wife has suspected that Nettie was their biological mother due to their close resemblance. It transpires that Olivia and Adam are Celie's long-lost children, and that she is their aunt. She also learns that Alphonso was not her and Celie's father but rather their stepfather. Their biological father, a store-owner, had been lynched by a mob of white men because they believed he was too successful. After Corrine's acceptance of Nettie's story, she dies, and Samuel and Nettie discover that they are deeply in love; they eventually marry.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having read the letters and learned the truth about her children as well as her biological father, Celie visits Alphonso to confirm the story, which he does. Celie finds a new sense of empowerment, and at dinner one night she releases her pent-up anger at "Mr.", cursing him for the years of abuse that she has had to endure. Shug, Celie, and Squeak decide to move to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, where Celie begins a lucrative business designing and sewing tailored pants together. She returns to Georgia for a visit and finds that not only has "Mr." reformed himself and his ways, but Alphonso has died. She finds out that the shop, house and land she thought was his had been willed to her and Nettie when their mother died. Celie decides to move back, relocating her business. Soon after, Shug falls for nineteen-year-old Germaine and travels with him across the country in a last hurrah for her youth.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, Nettie and Samuel are preparing for their return to America. Adam falls in love with and marries an African girl named Tashi, who undergoes the painful rituals of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_cutting" title="Female genital cutting">female genital cutting</a> and facial scarification. Adam also goes through the facial scarring ritual in solidarity. Nettie writes to Celie to let her know that the family is on their way.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Themes">Themes</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The female relationships are friendly and sisterly and also sexual. Celie and Sofia have a friendly relationship with each other because Celie was Sofiaâ€™s stepmother in law, and they befriended each other because the men in their life treated them poorly. Shug Avery had a large number of shallow relationships in her life previous to Celie, and Celie had always been in relationships that were the product of real or implied threats of violence. As such, she had never fallen in love. After pursuing a relationship with one another they found happiness in life. What makes the woman-woman relationship attractive is the stark contrast afforded by all of Celie's heterosexual contacts. It is really the first time that she has experienced love and sharing and appreciation in any way related to her sexual life. Celie and Nettie provide the sisterly relationship in the novel. Nettie is Celieâ€™s hope and faith for life. They constantly push each other throughout the book to stay true to the Christian God, and they believe that they will meet again one day.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Symbols">Symbols</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the start of the novel, Celie views God as completely separate from her world. She writes to God because she has no other way to express her feelings. Celie's writing to God thrusts her into a rich symbolic life which results in her repudiation of the life she has been assigned and a desire for a more expansive daily existence. Her faith is strong, but itâ€™s dependent on only what other people have revealed to her about God. Later she tells Shug that she sees God as white man. She has this belief because everyone she knows has said God is white and a male. Later, Shug tells her God has no race or gender. This enables Celie to see God in a different way. She realizes that you cannot place qualities on God because God is a part of the unknown. Her faith is now based on her interpretation of God, not one she learned from someone else. Even though Shug helped her with this realization, Celie only used this knowledge to shape her faith. Shug was a huge influence on Celieâ€™s faith, but Celie was the one that had to choose how she would express it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The title of the book is a very important symbol. Celie goes through life having a hard time noticing the beautiful aspects and appreciating them. She had a difficult life and was abused as an adolescent. The color purple is continually equated with suffering and pain. Sofia's swollen, beaten face is described as the color of "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eggplant" title="Eggplant">eggplant</a>".Â : the site of her sexual violation. However, later Shug points out to her that you have to enjoy life. When they were in a field of purple flowers, Shug tells Celie to look at the flowers and embrace their beauty. "You must look at all the good and acknowledge them because God placed them all on earth". After learning this, Celie has a better respect for life and everything it has to offer.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Character_Analysis">Character Analysis</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Celie is the main character, who has been oppressed by men her whole life. As an adolescent she is raped by her stepfather and soon thereafter gives birth. Her children are taken away. Her stepfather gives her away to be married to Albert. She becomes friends with Shug, which leads to a sexual relationship between the two. Celie learns many things about herself and her body due to Shug. She models herself after Shug and becomes more independent the more she listens to Shug's views and opinions. Shug influences not only the way that Celie allows Albert to treat her, but also her religious views. In showing Celie that it is all right to commit sin but still believe in and live for God, she broadens Celie's view on religion. It is also Shug who frees Celie from Albert's bondage, first by loving her, then by helping her to start a custom sewing business. From Shug, Celie learns that Albert has been hiding letters written to her from Africa by her sister Nettie, a missionary. These letters, full of educated, firsthand observation of African life, form a moving counterpoint to Celie's life. They reveal that in Africa, just as in America, women are persistently oppressed by men. </p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Miss Millie is the woman by whom Sofia is forced into slavery as punishment for hitting the mayor. She considers herself very liberal, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toleration" title="Toleration">tolerant</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian" title="Humanitarian">humanitarian</a>, because she does things like organize fundraisers for black children, but she reveals her own behavior to be somewhat deceptive and phony. When she first met Sofia she assumed she was unemployed and couldn't foresee why she as a white woman asking Sofia to be her maid would be offensive to her. Later as she is trying to drive herself back home after dropping Sofia off for her first holiday visit with her family in years she has problems getting the car to cooperate because of her lack of experience and talent with driving. As Sofia's family members, most of them men, try to help her get started (and lessen the likelihood of her crashing into the house or hurting herself) her instincts take over and she begins panicking and shouting in her presumption that all a bunch of black men would be trying to do to her as a white woman is "attack" her. She then goes on to state plainly that she won't allow any black person, especially a black man, she doesn't know to drive her home alone, even if it is one of Sofia's family members and insists that Sofia be the one to do it, possibly because she doesn't think Sofia capable of harming little kids and previous experience with the wrath of the mayor and sheriff. In spite of her best efforts to be <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism" title="Progressivism">progressive</a> she is still a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigot" title="Bigot">bigot</a> and is actually a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypocrite" title="Hypocrite">hypocrite</a>.</p>
