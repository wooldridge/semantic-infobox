	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the opening scene, 20-year-old Alice Ayres (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman" title="Natalie Portman">Natalie Portman</a>) and Dan Woolf (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Law" title="Jude Law">Jude Law</a>) see each other for the first time from opposite sides of a street in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.

Alice <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic" title="Right- and left-hand traffic">looks in the wrong direction</a> as she crosses the street and is hit by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab" title="Taxicab">taxicab</a> right in front of Dan. He rushes over. She smiles to him and says, "Hello, stranger". He takes her to a hospital, where Alice is treated and released. Afterward, on the way to his office, they stop by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postman%27s_Park" title="Postman's Park">Postman's Park</a>, the same park that he and his father visited after his mother's death. Before he leaves her and goes to work, he asks her for her name. They soon start a relationship.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A year later, Dan is straying. He has written a novel based on Alice's life and while being photographed to publicize it, he flirts with the American <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography" title="Photography">photographer</a> Anna Cameron (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Roberts" title="Julia Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>). Anna shares a kiss with Dan before finding out that Dan and Alice are in a relationship. Alice arrives and borrows Anna's bathroom, leaving Anna and Dan alone again. Dan takes the chance to try to persuade Anna into having an affair with him but is cut short by Alice's return. Alice asks Anna if she can have her portrait taken as well. Anna agrees and Alice asks Dan to leave them alone during the photo shooting. While being photographed, she reveals to Anna that she overheard them, and is photographed weeping. Alice does not reveal what she overheard to Dan, even as he spends a year <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalking" title="Stalking">stalking</a> Anna, who resists.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another year later, Dan enters a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersex" title="Cybersex">cybersex</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chat_room" title="Chat room">chat room</a> and randomly meets Larry Gray (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Owen" title="Clive Owen">Clive Owen</a>), a British <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dermatology" title="Dermatology">dermatologist</a>. With Anna still on his mind, Dan pretends to be her, and using the pretense that they will be having sex, Dan convinces Larry to meet at the aquarium (where Anna told Dan she often went). Larry goes to the meeting place where by coincidence Anna is. Feeling foolish, Larry apologizes but is confused by the situation. Anna tells Larry that a man who had pursued her, Dan, was most likely to blame for the setup. Soon, Anna and Larry become a couple and they refer to Dan as "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupid" title="Cupid">Cupid</a>" as their inside joke.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alice goes back to stripping to support herself while staying in London, being still in love with Dan. One day, Larry runs into her accidentally at the strip club and he (heart-broken himself) realizes that he knows her, (even though she is wearing a pink wig). He asks her if her name is Alice (knowing full-well who she is), but no matter how much money he gives her, she keeps telling him her name is "Jane Jones." He asks her to come home with him so he can look after her, but she refuses. The line of questioning becomes pornographic, albeit without any explicit <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity" title="Nudity">nudity</a>, when Larry asks Alice: "What does your <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cunt" title="Cunt">cunt</a> taste like?" Alice replies with a smile: "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>". Larry then demands: "Alice, tell me something true". Alice replies: "Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off, ... but it's better if you do". The full <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony" title="Irony">irony</a> of Alice's response is not apparent until the conclusion of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alice takes Dan back and she decides to take them both to America as a surprise vacation. They are in a hotel room near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heathrow_Airport" title="Heathrow Airport">Heathrow Airport</a> happy to be back together. Alice notes that today is the day when they first met on that London street exactly four years ago. They reminisce and then Dan can't help himself and asks her whether she had a one-night stand with Larry, which she initially denies. When he insists on the truth, she suddenly tells him that she doesn't love him anymore and goes on to say that she did sleep with Larry that night he found her working at the strip club. Dan then reveals that Larry had already told him about the one-night stand but that he's already forgiven her. She is angry that he tricked her and insists that it's over and tells him to leave. He refuses, but she tells him that if he doesn't go voluntarily that she will call security. He does not believe this, and so she picks up the phone. He grabs her arm and questions her angrily about why she slept with Larry, she eventually says it's because Dan wasn't there, they continue to argue and she spits in his face. Dan almost hits her but refrains. She encourages him to hit her and he does. She looks at him in shock.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Dan hits her, Alice returns to New York alone. Passing through the immigration checkpoint on her way back into the United States, it is revealed through a shot of her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport" title="Passport">passport</a> that her name is indeed Jane Rachel Jones (the name she had given Larry in the strip club) and that she had lied about her name for the duration of her four-year relationship with Dan.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Back in London, Dan returns to Postman's Park, and to his surprise, notices the name "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Ayres" title="Alice Ayres">Alice Ayres</a>" on a tile that is dedicated to a girl, "who by intrepid conduct", and at the cost of her young life, saved three children. The final scene shows Alice/Jane walking on Broadway (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Times_Square" title="Times Square">Times Square</a>) towards <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/47th_Street_(Manhattan)" title="47th Street (Manhattan)">W 47th St</a>, in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, approaching a red "do not walk" pedestrian light, where passers-by are turning their heads staring at her, stunned at her beauty; a scene symmetrical with the opening scene, where Alice/Jane and Dan are staring at each other on the streets of London.</p>

Peter Travers writing for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> said "Mike Nichols haunting, hypnotic Closer vibrates with eroticism, bruising laughs and dynamite performances from four attractive actors doing decidedly unattractive things."
