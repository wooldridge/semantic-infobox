      <wiki:abstract>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Joan Crawford</b> (March 23, 1905 â€“ May 10, 1977), born <b>Lucille Fay LeSueur</b>, was an American actress in film, television and theatre. Starting as a dancer in traveling theatrical companies before debuting on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>, Crawford was signed to a motion picture contract by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> in 1925. Initially frustrated by the size and quality of her parts, Crawford began a campaign of self-publicity and became nationally known as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapper" title="Flapper">flapper</a> by the end of the 1920s. In the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled MGM colleagues <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>. Crawford often played hardworking young women who find romance and financial success. These "rags-to-riches" stories were well-received by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Depression</a>-era audiences and were popular with women. Crawford became one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood's</a> most prominent movie stars and one of the highest paid women in the United States, but her films began losing money and by the end of the 1930s she was labeled "box office poison".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After an absence of nearly two years from the screen, Crawford staged a comeback by starring in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)" title="Mildred Pierce (film)">Mildred Pierce</a></i> (1945), for which she won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>. In 1955, she became involved with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PepsiCo" title="PepsiCo">Pepsi-Cola Company</a> through her marriage to company Chairman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Steele" title="Alfred Steele">Alfred Steele</a>. After his death in 1959, Crawford was elected to fill his vacancy on the board of directors but was forcibly retired in 1973. She continued acting in film and television regularly through the 1960s, when her performances became fewer; after the release of the British horror film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trog" title="Trog">Trog</a></i> in 1970, Crawford retired from the screen. Following a public appearance in 1974, after which unflattering photographs were published, Crawford withdrew from public life and became more and more reclusive until her death in 1977.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crawford married four times. Her first three marriages ended in divorce; the last ended with the death of husband Al Steele. She adopted five children, one of whom was reclaimed by his birth mother. Crawford's relationships with her two older children, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Crawford" title="Christina Crawford">Christina</a> and Christopher, were acrimonious. Crawford disinherited the two and, after Crawford's death, Christina wrote a "tell-all" memoir, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mommie_Dearest" title="Mommie Dearest">Mommie Dearest</a></i>, in which she alleged a lifelong pattern of physical and emotional abuse perpetrated by Crawford.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crawford was born <b>Lucille Fay LeSueur</b> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio,_Texas" title="San Antonio, Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, the third child of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>-born Thomas E. LeSueur (1868â€“1938), a laundry laborer of French Huguenot and English ancestry, and Anna Bell Johnson (1884â€“1958), who was of Swedish and Irish descent. Her older siblings were Daisy LeSueur, who died very young, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_LeSueur" title="Hal LeSueur">Hal LeSueur</a>. Thomas LeSueur abandoned the family a few months before Crawford's birth. He reappeared in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abilene,_Texas" title="Abilene, Texas">Abilene</a>, Texas, in 1930 as a 62-year-old construction laborer on the George R. Davis House, built in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_School" title="Prairie School">Prairie School</a> architecture.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crawford's mother subsequently married Henry J. Cassin. The family lived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawton,_Oklahoma" title="Lawton, Oklahoma">Lawton, Oklahoma</a>, where Cassin ran a movie theater. Crawford was unaware that Cassin was not her birth father until her brother Hal told her. The 1910 federal census for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_County,_Oklahoma" title="Comanche County, Oklahoma">Comanche County, Oklahoma</a>, enumerated on April 20, showed Henry and Anna living at 910 "D" Street in Lawton. Crawford was listed as five years old, thus showing 1905 as her likely year of birth. However, the state of Texas did not require the filing of birth certificates until 1908, allowing Crawford to claim she was born in 1908.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Crawford preferred the nickname "Billie" as a child and she loved watching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> acts perform on the stage of her stepfather's theater. Her ambition was to be a dancer. However, in an attempt to escape piano lessons to run and play with friends, she leapt from the front porch of her home and cut her foot deeply on a broken milk bottle. Crawford had three operations and was unable to attend elementary school for a year and a half. She eventually fully recovered and returned to dancing.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Around 1916, Crawford's family moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. Cassin was first listed in the City Directory in 1917, living at 403 East Ninth Street. While still in elementary school, Crawford was placed in St. Agnes Academy, a Catholic school in Kansas City. Later, after her mother and stepfather broke up, she stayed on at St. Agnes as a work student. She then went to Rockingham Academy as a work student. While attending Rockingham she began dating and had her first serious relationship, with a trumpet player named Ray Sterling. It was Sterling who inspired her to begin challenging herself academically, and in 1922, Crawford registered at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephens_College" title="Stephens College">Stephens College</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri" title="Columbia, Missouri">Columbia, Missouri</a>. She gave her year of birth as 1906. Crawford attended Stephens for less than a year, as she recognized that she was not academically prepared for college.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Under the name Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began dancing in the choruses of traveling revues and was spotted dancing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit" title="Detroit">Detroit</a> by producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_J._Shubert" title="Jacob J. Shubert">Jacob J. Shubert</a>. Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show <i>Innocent Eyes</i> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Garden_Theatre" title="Winter Garden Theatre">Winter Garden Theatre</a> on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_(theatre)" title="Broadway (theatre)">Broadway</a> in New York City. While appearing in <i>Innocent Eyes</i> Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924 and the couple lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford. She wanted additional work and approached <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loews_Theaters" title="Loews Theaters">Loews Theaters</a> publicist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Granlund" title="Nils Granlund">Nils Granlund</a>. Granlund secured a position for her with producer Harry Richmond's act and arranged for her to do a screen test which he sent to producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Rapf" title="Harry Rapf">Harry Rapf</a> in Hollywood. Stories have persisted that Crawford further supplemented her income by appearing in one or more <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornographic_film" title="Pornographic film">stag</a>, or soft-core pornographic, films, although this has been disputed. Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924 that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week. Granlund immediately wired LeSueur â€“ who had returned to her mother's home in Kansas City â€“ with the news; she borrowed $400 (which she never paid back) for travel expenses. The night after Christmas she left Kansas City and arrived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culver_City,_California" title="Culver City, California">Culver City, California</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Lucille LeSueur, her first film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Ladies" title="Pretty Ladies">Pretty Ladies</a></i> in 1925, which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZaSu_Pitts" title="ZaSu Pitts">ZaSu Pitts</a>. Also in 1925 she appeared in a small role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Only_Thing" title="The Only Thing">The Only Thing</a></i> and in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Clothes" title="Old Clothes">Old Clothes</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Coogan" title="Jackie Coogan">Jackie Coogan</a>. MGM publicity head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Smith_(film_producer)" title="Pete Smith (film producer)">Pete Smith</a> recognized her ability but felt that her name sounded fake; it also, he told studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a>, sounded like "Le Sewer". Smith organized a contest in conjunction with the fan magazine <i>Movie Weekly</i> to allow readers to select her new name. Initially the name "Joan Arden" was selected but, when another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate name "Crawford" became the choice. Crawford initially wanted her new first name to be pronounced "Jo-anne". She hated the name Crawford, saying it sounded like "crawfish". Her friend, actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Haines" title="William Haines">William Haines</a>, quipped, "They might have called you 'Cranberry' and served you every Thanksgiving with the turkey!" Crawford continued to dislike the name throughout her life but, she said, "liked the security that went with it".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Growing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederica_Sagor_Maas" title="Frederica Sagor Maas">Frederica Sagor Maas</a> recalled, "No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star." She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charleston_(dance)" title="Charleston (dance)">Charleston</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bottom_(dance)" title="Black Bottom (dance)">Black Bottom</a>. Her strategy worked, and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Goulding" title="Edmund Goulding">Edmund Goulding</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally,_Irene_and_Mary" title="Sally, Irene and Mary">Sally, Irene and Mary</a></i> (1925). She played Irene, a struggling chorus girl. In the same year, Crawford worked on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Night" title="Lady of the Night">Lady of the Night</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a>. Crawford was made up and used as a double for Shearer and her face is briefly seen. Crawford coveted the roles that Shearer played but knew that Shearer's husband, producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>, guaranteed Shearer first choice of roles in any MGM property. "How can I compete with Norma?" Crawford was quoted as saying. "She sleeps with the boss."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The following year, Crawford was named one of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAMPAS_Baby_Stars" title="WAMPAS Baby Stars">WAMPAS Baby Stars</a>, along with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Astor" title="Mary Astor">Mary Astor</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Brian" title="Mary Brian">Mary Brian</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_Costello" title="Dolores Costello">Dolores Costello</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolores_del_R%C3%ADo" title="Dolores del RÃ­o">Dolores del RÃ­o</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Gaynor" title="Janet Gaynor">Janet Gaynor</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fay_Wray" title="Fay Wray">Fay Wray</a>. For the next two years, Crawford appeared in increasingly important films. In 1926, she made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(1926_film)" title="Paris (1926 film)">Paris</a></i>, where she was able to show her sex appeal. She became the romantic interest for some of MGM's leading male stars, among them <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram%C3%B3n_Novarro" title="RamÃ³n Novarro">RamÃ³n Novarro</a>, William Haines, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilbert_(actor)" title="John Gilbert (actor)">John Gilbert</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_McCoy" title="Tim McCoy">Tim McCoy</a>. Crawford appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unknown_(1927_film)" title="The Unknown (1927 film)">The Unknown</a></i> (1927), starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lon_Chaney,_Sr." title="Lon Chaney, Sr.">Lon Chaney, Sr.</a> who played a carnival knife thrower with no arms. Crawford played his skimpily clad young carnival assistant whom he hopes to marry. She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anything else in her career. "It was then", she said, "I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1928, Crawford starred opposite RamÃ³n Novarro in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_to_Singapore" title="Across to Singapore">Across to Singapore</a></i>, but it was her role as Diana Medford in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Dancing_Daughters" title="Our Dancing Daughters">Our Dancing Daughters</a></i> (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity that rivaled the image of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow" title="Clara Bow">Clara Bow</a>, the original IT girl, and who was at that time Hollywood's foremost <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapper" title="Flapper">flapper</a>. A stream of hits followed <i>Our Dancing Daughters</i>, including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F._Scott_Fitzgerald" title="F. Scott Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> wrote of her:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On June 3, 1929, Crawford married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks,_Jr." title="Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Malachy%27s_Roman_Catholic_Church" title="Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church">Saint Malachy's Roman Catholic Church</a> in New York City. Fairbanks was the son of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks" title="Douglas Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a> and the stepson of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Pickford" title="Mary Pickford">Mary Pickford</a>, who were considered Hollywood royalty. Fairbanks Sr. and Pickford were opposed to the marriage and did not invite the couple to their home, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickfair" title="Pickfair">Pickfair</a>, for eight months after the marriage. The relationship between Crawford and Fairbanks, Sr. eventually warmed; she called him "Uncle Doug" and he called her "Billie". Following that first invitation, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr. became more frequent guests, which was hard on Crawford. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, Crawford was left with Pickford or left alone.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To rid herself of her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States" title="Southwestern United States">Southwestern</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(linguistics)" title="Accent (linguistics)">accent</a>, Crawford tirelessly practiced diction and elocution. She said:</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_film" title="Sound film">talkie</a> was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untamed_(1929_film)" title="Untamed (1929 film)">Untamed</a></i> (1929), opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a>, which was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office" title="Box office">box office</a> success. Crawford made an effective transition to sound movies. One critic wrote, "Miss Crawford sings appealingly and dances thrillingly as usual; her voice is alluring and her dramatic efforts in the difficult role she portrays are at all times convincing."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With the early sound film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Blushing_Brides" title="Our Blushing Brides">Our Blushing Brides</a></i> (1930), another financial success, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> began to develop a more sophisticated image of Crawford, rather than continuing to promote her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flapper" title="Flapper">flapper</a> girl persona of the silent era. In 1931, she starred opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessed_(1931_film)" title="Possessed (1931 film)">Possessed</a></i>. They began an affair during the production, resulting in an ultimatum from studio chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> to Gable that the affair end. Gable complied, although for many years their affair resumed sporadically and secretly. Upon release, <i>Possessed</i> was an enormous hit.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The studio then cast her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Hotel_(film)" title="Grand Hotel (film)">Grand Hotel</a></i>, which starred the most famous actors of the 1930s and was MGM's most prestigious movie of 1932. Crawford later achieved continued success with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letty_Lynton" title="Letty Lynton">Letty Lynton</a></i> (1932). Soon after its release, a plagiarism suit forced MGM to withdraw it. It has never been shown on television or made available on home video, and is therefore considered the "lost" Crawford film. The film is mostly remembered because of the "Letty Lynton dress", designed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_(costume_designer)" title="Adrian (costume designer)">Adrian</a>: a white cotton organdy gown with large ruffled sleeves, puffed at the shoulder. It was with this gown that Crawford's broad shoulders began to be accentuated by costume. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macy%27s" title="Macy's">Macy's</a> copied the dress in 1932, and it sold over 500,000 replicas nationwide.</p>

The couple built a small theatre at Crawford's Brentwood home and put on productions of classic plays for select groups of friends. Before and during their marriage, Crawford worked to promote Tone's Hollywood career but Tone was ultimately not interested in being a movie star and Crawford eventually wearied of the effort. Tone began drinking and physically abusing Crawford and she filed for divorce, which was granted in 1939. Crawford and Tone eventually reconciled their friendship and Tone even proposed in 1964 that they remarry.

After she told the story to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>, Pepsi reversed its position and Crawford was elected to fill the vacant seat on the board of directors.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After her triumph in RKO's <i>Sudden Fear</i>, Crawford appeared in films ranging from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_(style)" title="Camp (style)">camp</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Guitar" title="Johnny Guitar">Johnny Guitar</a></i> (1954) to the drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn_Leaves_(film)" title="Autumn Leaves (film)">Autumn Leaves</a></i> (1956), opposite a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Robertson" title="Cliff Robertson">Cliff Robertson</a>.

The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. However, Crawford accused Davis of kicking her during the filming of a scene in which Jane attacks Blanche, and reportedly retaliated by wearing weights under her clothes in a scene in which Davis had to carry her. The director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich" title="Robert Aldrich">Robert Aldrich</a>, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly." After filming was completed, their public comments against each other allowed the tension to develop into a lifelong feud. The film became a huge success, recouping its costs in 11 days of nationwide release and temporarily reviving Crawford's career. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford secretly contacted all the other Oscar nominees to tell them if they were unable to attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf.

Crawford was devastated. "I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed", Crawford said. "I wept for 39 hours." Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, "He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things." (to which Aldrich replied, "If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford.")</p>

When Crawford saw the unflattering photos of both stars that appeared in the papers the next day, she said, "If that's how I look, then they won't see me anymore." Crawford canceled all public appearances, began declining interviews and left her apartment less and less. Her dental-related issues, including surgery which left her in need of round the clock nursing care, also plagued her from 1972 until the middle of 1975. While on antibiotics for this problem in October 1974, Crawford's drinking caused her to black out, slip and strike her face. This incident scared her enough to give up drinking and smoking, although in public she insisted it was due to her return to Christian Science. The whole incident is recorded in a series of letters sent to her insurance company held at the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts, as well as being documented by her friend, Carl Johnnes, in his book.</p>

Later, she meets Lester on a train bound for San Francisco, is swept off her feet, and, after a brief courtship, marries him.

Myra discovers their plans and concocts a diabolical scheme to kill Lester and place the blame on Irene, but cannot bring herself to go through with it.

With her wide eyes and forceful bearing, she is the woman for the job."<small></small> In 1984, writer Spencer Selby noted, "Undoubtedly one of the most stylish and refined woman-in-distress noirs."</p>
