With his distinctive yet not quite placeable <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_English" title="Mid-Atlantic English">Mid-Atlantic</a> accent, he was noted as perhaps the foremost exemplar of the debonair leading man: handsome, virile, charismatic, and charming.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Archibald Alexander Leach was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horfield" title="Horfield">Horfield</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, to Elsie Maria Kingdon (1877â€“1973) and Elias James Leach (1873â€“1935). An only child, he had an unhappy childhood, attending Bishop Road Primary School. His mother had suffered from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression" title="Clinical depression">depression</a> since the death of a previous child. His father placed her in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_institution" title="Mental institution">mental institution</a>, and told his nine-year-old son only that she had gone away on a "long holiday"; it was not until he was in his thirties that Grant discovered her alive, in an institutionalized care facility.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He was expelled from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Grammar_School" title="Fairfield Grammar School">Fairfield Grammar School</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> in 1918. He subsequently joined the "Bob Pender stage troupe" and travelled with the group to the United States as a stilt walker in 1920 at the age of 16, on a two-year tour of the country. He was processed at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellis_Island" title="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</a> on July 28, 1920. When the troupe returned to the UK, he decided to stay in the U.S. and continue his stage career. During this time, he became a part of the vaudeville world and toured with Parker, Rand and Leach. (After departing the troupe, he was to be replaced by a young James Cagney for a brief time.) Still using his birth name, he performed on the stage at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Muny" title="The Muny">The Muny</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri" title="St. Louis, Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>, in such shows as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_(musical)" title="Irene (musical)">Irene</a></i> (1931); <i>Music in May</i> (1931); <i>Nina Rosa</i> (1931); <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Rita_(musical)" title="Rio Rita (musical)">Rio Rita</a></i> (1931); <i>Street Singer</i> (1931); <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers_(musical)" title="The Three Musketeers (musical)">The Three Musketeers</a></i> (1931); and <i>Wonderful Night</i> (1931).</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After some success in light <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> comedies, he went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> in 1931, where he acquired the name Cary Lockwood. He chose the name Lockwood after the surname of his character in a recent play called <i>Nikki</i>. He signed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, but while studio bosses were impressed with him, they were less than impressed with his adopted stage name. They decided that the name Cary was acceptable, but Lockwood had to go due to a similarity with another actor's name. It was after browsing through a list of the studio's preferred surnames, that "Cary Grant" was born. Grant chose the name because the initials C and G had already proved lucky for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>, two of Hollywood's biggest <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_star" title="Movie star">movie stars</a>.</p>

Paramount put Grant in a series of unsuccessful films until 1936, when he signed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for several decades. He was a versatile actor, who did demanding <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_comedy" title="Physical comedy">physical comedy</a> in movies such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunga_Din_(film)" title="Gunga Din (film)">Gunga Din</a></i> (1939) with the skills he had learned on the stage. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hawks" title="Howard Hawks">Howard Hawks</a> said that Grant was "so far the best that there isn't anybody to be compared to him".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was a favorite of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>, who said that Grant was "the only actor I ever loved in my whole life". Grant appeared in the Hitchcock classics <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicion_(film)" title="Suspicion (film)">Suspicion</a></i> (1941), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notorious_(1946_film)" title="Notorious (1946 film)">Notorious</a></i> (1946), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Catch_a_Thief_(film)" title="To Catch a Thief (film)">To Catch a Thief</a></i> (1955) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest" title="North by Northwest">North by Northwest</a></i> (1959). Biographer Patrick McGilligan wrote that, in 1965, Hitchcock asked Grant to star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torn_Curtain" title="Torn Curtain">Torn Curtain</a></i> (1966), only to learn that Grant had decided to retire after making one more film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walk,_Don%27t_Run" title="Walk, Don't Run">Walk, Don't Run</a></i> (1966); <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Newman" title="Paul Newman">Paul Newman</a> was cast instead, opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Andrews" title="Julie Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the mid-1950s, Grant formed his own production company, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Grantley_Productions&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Grantley Productions (page does not exist)">Grantley Productions</a>, and produced a number of movies distributed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a>, such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Petticoat" title="Operation Petticoat">Operation Petticoat</a></i> (1959), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiscreet_(1958_film)" title="Indiscreet (1958 film)">Indiscreet</a></i> (1958), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Touch_of_Mink" title="That Touch of Mink">That Touch of Mink</a></i> (co-starring with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" title="Doris Day">Doris Day</a>, 1962), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Goose_(film)" title="Father Goose (film)">Father Goose</a></i> (1964). In 1963, he appeared opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charade" title="Charade">Charade</a></i> (1963).

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was the first actor to "go independent" by not renewing his studio contract, effectively bucking the old <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_system" title="Studio system">studio system</a>, which almost completely controlled what an actor could or could not do. In this way, Grant was able to control every aspect of his career, at the risk of not working because no particular studio had an interest in his career long term. He decided which movies he was going to appear in, he often had personal choice of the directors and his co-stars and at times even negotiated a share of the gross, something uncommon at the time.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was nominated for two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a> in the 1940s. Grant received a special <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Honorary_Award" title="Academy Honorary Award">Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement</a> in 1970. In 1981, he was accorded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Center_Honors" title="Kennedy Center Honors">Kennedy Center Honors</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1962, a few years before retiring, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> reported that he had once received a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegram" title="Telegram">telegram</a> from a magazine editor asking him "HOW OLD CARY GRANT?" Grant was reported to have responded with "OLD CARY GRANT FINE. HOW YOU?"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Never self absorbed, he even poked fun at himself with statements such as, "Everyone wants to be Cary Grantâ€”even I want to be Cary Grant".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Grant had retired from the screen, he remained active in other areas. In the late 1960s, he accepted a position on the board of directors at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9" title="FabergÃ©">FabergÃ©</a>. By all accounts this position was not honorary, as some had assumed, Grant regularly attended meetings and his mere appearance at a product launch would almost certainly guarantee its success. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyan_Cannon" title="Dyan Cannon">Dyan Cannon</a>, was working. He later joined the boards of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Park" title="Hollywood Park">Hollywood Park</a>, Western Airlines (now Delta Air Lines), and MGM.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the last few years of his life, Grant undertook tours of the United States in a one-man show. It was called "A Conversation with Cary Grant", in which he would show clips from his films and answer audience questions. Grant was preparing for a performance at the Adler Theater in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davenport,_Iowa" title="Davenport, Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a> on the afternoon of 29 November 1986 when he suffered a massive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemorrhage" title="Cerebral hemorrhage">cerebral hemorrhage</a>. He had previously suffered a minor stroke in October 1984. He died at 11:22Â pm  in St. Luke's Hospital.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2001 a statue of Grant was erected in Millennium Square, a regenerated area next to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Harbour" title="Bristol Harbour">harbour</a> in his city of birth, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a>, England.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In November 2004, Grant was named "The Greatest Movie Star of All Time" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premiere_Magazine" title="Premiere Magazine">Premiere Magazine</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schickel" title="Richard Schickel">Richard Schickel</a>, the film critic, said about Grant: "He's the best star actor there ever was in the movies."<br style="clear:both"/></p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was married five times, and was dogged by rumors that he was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexual" title="Bisexual">bisexual</a>. He wed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Cherrill" title="Virginia Cherrill">Virginia Cherrill</a> on February 10, 1934. She divorced him on March 26, 1935, following charges that Grant had hit her. He married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Hutton" title="Barbara Hutton">Barbara Hutton</a>, one of the wealthiest women in the world, and became a father figure to her son, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Reventlow" title="Lance Reventlow">Lance Reventlow</a>. The couple was derisively nicknamed "Cash and Cary", although in an extensive prenuptial agreement Grant refused any financial settlement in the event of a divorce. After divorcing in 1945, they remained lifelong friends. Grant always bristled at the accusation that he married for money: "I may not have married for very sound reasons, but money was never one of them."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On December 25, 1949, Grant married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Drake" title="Betsy Drake">Betsy Drake</a>. He appeared with her in two films. This would prove to be his longest marriage, ending on August 14, 1962. Drake introduced Grant to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD" title="LSD">LSD</a>, and in the early 1960s he related how treatment with the hallucinogenic drugâ€”legal at the timeâ€”at a prestigious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> clinic had finally brought him inner peace after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">yoga</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypnotism" title="Hypnotism">hypnotism</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> had proved ineffective. The couple divorced in 1962.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He eloped with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyan_Cannon" title="Dyan Cannon">Dyan Cannon</a> on July 22, 1965 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a>. Their daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Grant" title="Jennifer Grant">Jennifer Grant</a>, was born prematurely on February 26, 1966. He frequently called her his "best production", and regretted that he had not had children sooner. The marriage was troubled from the beginning and Cannon left him in December 1966, claiming that Grant flew into frequent rages and spanked her when she "disobeyed" him. The divorce, finalized in 1968, was bitter and public, and custody fights over their daughter went on for nearly ten years.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On April 11, 1981, Grant married long-time companion, British hotel public relations agent Barbara Harris, who was 47 years his junior. They renewed their vows on their fifth wedding anniversary. Fifteen years after Grant's death, Harris married former All-American quarterback <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jaynes" title="David Jaynes">David Jaynes</a> in 2001.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant allegedly was involved with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costume_design" title="Costume design">costume designer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orry-Kelly" title="Orry-Kelly">Orry-Kelly</a> when he first moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, and lived with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_Scott" title="Randolph Scott">Randolph Scott</a> off and on for twelve years. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blackwell" title="Richard Blackwell">Richard Blackwell</a> wrote that Grant and Scott were "deeply, madly in love", and alleged eyewitness accounts of their physical affection have been published. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>  and screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laurents" title="Arthur Laurents">Arthur Laurents</a> also have alleged that Grant was bisexual, the latter writing that Grant "told me he threw pebbles at my window one night but was luckless". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_D%27Arcy" title="Alexander D'Arcy">Alexander D'Arcy</a>, who appeared with Grant in <i>The Awful Truth</i>, said he knew that he and Scott "lived together as a gay couple", adding: "I think Cary knew that people were saying things about him. I don't think he tried to hide it." The two men frequently accompanied each other to parties and premieres and were unconcerned when photographs of them cozily preparing dinner together at home were published in fan magazines.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Barbara, Grant's widow, has disputed that there was a relationship with Scott. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevy_Chase" title="Chevy Chase">Chevy Chase</a> joked about Grant being gay in a television interview, he sued him for slander; they settled out of court. However, Grant did admit in an interview that his first two wives had accused him of being homosexual. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betsy_Drake" title="Betsy Drake">Betsy Drake</a> commented: "Why would I believe that Cary was homosexual when we were busy fucking? Maybe he was bisexual. He lived 43 years before he met me. I don't know what he did."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grant was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Republican_Party" title="United States Republican Party">Republican</a>, but did not think movie stars should publicly make political declarations. Grant described his politics and his reticence about them this way:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Throughout his life, Grant maintained personal friendships with colleagues of varying political stripes and his few political activities seemed to be shaped by personal friendships. Repulsed by the human costs to many in Hollywood, Grant publicly condemned <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism" title="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> in 1953 and vocally defended his friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a> when the latter was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_blacklist" title="Hollywood blacklist">blacklisted</a>, insisting that Chaplin's artistic value outweighed political concerns. Grant was also a friend of the Kennedy brothers and made one of his rare statements on public issues following the assassination of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy" title="Robert F. Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a>, calling for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_control" title="Gun control">gun control</a>. In 1976, after his retirement from movies, Grant made his one overtly partisan appearance, introducing his friend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_Ford" title="Betty Ford">Betty Ford</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady" title="First Lady">First Lady</a>, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention" title="Republican National Convention">Republican National Convention</a>, but even in this he maintained some distance from partisanship, speaking of "your" party, rather than "ours" in his remarks. In 1958 Grant himself was criticized by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing" title="Right-wing">right-wing</a> columnist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> for vacationing in the Soviet Union after filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiscreet_(1958_film)" title="Indiscreet (1958 film)">Indiscreet</a></i> (1958). He appeared to inflame the controversy by remarking to an interviewer "I don't care what kind of government they have over there, I never had such a good time in my life".</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While listening to a recording of "Penny Serenade," Julie Gardiner Adams (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_Dunne" title="Irene Dunne">Irene Dunne</a>) begins reflecting on her past. Roger (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>) and Julie Adams suffer a tragedy when she <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarries</a> in an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquake</a> during their trip to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan" title="Japan">Japan</a>. They are told that she cannot have children. They request to adopt a two-year old boy, but ultimately adopt a much younger girl. They struggle to make ends meet and to retain their parental rights when Roger loses his job. When the little girl dies suddenly, the emotional strain threatens to destroy their marriage. Songs mark episodes in the action from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gramophone_record" title="Gramophone record">records</a> from their collection -- the title refers to a song of the same name. In the end, they are offered the opportunity to adopt a little boy who matches their original request, miraculously saving their marriage.</p>
