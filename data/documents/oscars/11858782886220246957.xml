Her first film role was in the 1970 television movie <i>Menace on the Mountain</i>, which was followed by several <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> productions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foster attended a French-language <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University-preparatory_school" title="University-preparatory school">prep school</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyc%C3%A9e_Fran%C3%A7ais_de_Los_Angeles" title="LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais de Los Angeles">LycÃ©e FranÃ§ais de Los Angeles</a>, and graduated in 1980 as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valedictorian" title="Valedictorian">valedictorian</a>.

She later gave the Class Day speech at her alma mater in 1994 and received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from the university in 1997.</p>

In 1969, she appeared in an episode of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunsmoke" title="Gunsmoke">Gunsmoke</a></i>, where she was credited as "Jody Foster". Although not a regular on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Courtship_of_Eddie%27s_Father" title="The Courtship of Eddie's Father">The Courtship of Eddie's Father</a></i>, she appeared from time to time as Eddie's friend Joey Kelly.

As a teenager, Foster made several appearances on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_pop_music" title="French pop music">French pop music</a> circuit as a singer. Commenting on her years as a child actress, which she describes as an "actor's career", Foster has said that "it was very clear to me at a young age that I had to fight for my life and that if I didn't, my life would get gobbled up and taken away from me." She hosted <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> at age 14, making her the youngest person to host at that time until <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Barrymore" title="Drew Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a> hosted at the age of seven.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foster made her debut (and only official) musical recordings in France in 1977: two 7" singles, "Je T'attends Depuis la Nuit des Temps" b/w "La Vie C'est Chouette" and "When I Looked at Your Face" backed with "La Vie C'est Chouette." The A-side of the former is sung in French, the A-side of the latter in English. The B-side of both is mostly spoken word and is performed in both French and English. These three recordings were included on the soundtrack to Foster's 1977 French film <i>Moi, fleur bleue</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Foster starred in three films in 1976: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_Driver" title="Taxi Driver">Taxi Driver</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugsy_Malone" title="Bugsy Malone">Bugsy Malone</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaky_Friday_(1976_film)" title="Freaky Friday (1976 film)">Freaky Friday</a></i>.

On March 30, 1981, he <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_assassination_attempt" title="Reagan assassination attempt">attempted to assassinate</a> U.S. President Ronald Reagan (shooting and wounding Reagan and three others) and claimed his motive was to impress Foster, then a Yale freshman. The media stormed the Yale campus in April "like a cavalry invasion," and followed Foster relentlessly. In 1982, she was called to testify during Hinckley's trial. After she responded to a question by saying that "I don't have any relationship with John Hinckley," he threw a pen at her and yelled "I'll get you, Foster!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Another man, Edward Richardson, followed Foster around Yale and planned to shoot her, but decided against it because she "was too pretty." This all caused intense discomfort to Foster, who has been known to walk out of interviews if Hinckley's name is even mentioned. In 1991, Foster cancelled an interview with NBC's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Today_(NBC_program)" title="Today (NBC program)">Today Show</a></i> when she discovered Hinckley would be mentioned in the introduction. Foster's only public reactions to this were a press conference afterwards and an article titled "Why Me?" that she wrote for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esquire_(magazine)" title="Esquire (magazine)">Esquire</a></i> in December 1982. In that article she wrote that returning to work on the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Svengali_(1983_film)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Svengali (1983 film) (page does not exist)">Svengali</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_O%27Toole" title="Peter O'Toole">Peter O'Toole</a> "made me fall in love with acting again" after the assassination attempt had shaken her confidence.

It primarily produced <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_film" title="Independent film">independent films</a> until it was closed in 2001. Foster said that she did not have the ambition to produce "big mainstream popcorn" movies, and as a child, independent films made her more interested in the movie business than mainstream ones.

He tasks her with interviewing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal_Lecter" title="Hannibal Lecter">Hannibal Lecter</a>, a former psychiatrist and incarcerated cannibalistic serial killer, believing Lecter's insight might be useful in the pursuit of a serial killer nicknamed "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jame_Gumb" title="Jame Gumb">Buffalo Bill</a>" who skins his female victims' corpses. Starling travels to the Baltimore State Hospital for the Criminally Insane, where she is led by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Frederick_Chilton" title="Dr. Frederick Chilton">Dr. Frederick Chilton</a> to Lecter's solitary quarters. Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's attempts at "dissecting" him and rebuffs her. As she is leaving, one of the prisoners obscenely flicks semen at her. Lecter, who considers discourtesy "unspeakably ugly," calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his. Starling is led to a storage lot where she discovers a man's severed head. She returns to Lecter, who tells her that the man is linked to Buffalo Bill. Though Lecter denies killing this man, he offers to profile Buffalo Bill if he can be transferred away from Chilton, whom he dislikes.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In light of Buffalo Bill's recent abduction of a U.S. Senator's daughter, Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps find Buffalo Bill and rescue the abductee. Instead, Lecter begins a game of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo" title="Quid pro quo">quid pro quo</a> with Starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about Buffalo Bill in exchange for events from Starling's childhood, something she was advised not to do. Chilton secretly records the conversation and reveals Starling's deal as a sham before offering to transfer Lecter in exchange for a deal of Chilton's own making. Lecter agrees and is flown to Memphis where he reveals personal information on Buffalo Bill to federal agents. As the manhunt begins, Starling visits Lecter at his special cell in a Tennessee courthouse and confronts him with her decryption of the name he provided ("Louis Friend," which is an anagram of "iron sulfide"). Lecter refuses Starling's pleas for the truth, as she believes everything he stated was false, and forces her to recount her traumatic childhood. She tells him how she was orphaned, relocated to a relative's farm, discovered a lamb slaughterhouse and failed in an attempt to rescue one of the lambs. Lecter gives her the case files on Buffalo Bill, after their conversation is interrupted by Chilton and the police who escort her from the building. Later that evening, Lecter manages to escape from his cell, killing his two guards in the process, and disappears.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Starling analyzes Lecter's annotations to the case files and realizes that Buffalo Bill's first victim knew him personally before he killed her. Starling travels to the victim's hometown and discovers that Buffalo Bill was a tailor, with dresses and templates identical to the patches of skin removed from each of his victims. She telephones Crawford to inform him that Buffalo Bill is trying to fashion a "woman suit" of real skin, but Crawford is already en route to make an arrest, having cross-referenced Lecter's notes with a hospital's archives and finding a man named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jame_Gumb" title="Jame Gumb">Jame Gumb</a> who once applied for a sex-change operation. Starling continues interviewing friends of Buffalo Bill's first victim while Crawford leads an FBI tactical team to Gumb's address in Illinois. Starling is led to the house of "Jack Gordon," who she realizes is actually Jame Gumb. She pursues him into his multi-room basement where she discovers the recently abducted Senator's daughter alive, but traumatized and trapped in a dry well. After turning off the basement lights, Gumb stalks Starling in the dark with night vision goggles but gives his position away when he cocks his revolver, and is shot to death by Starling.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some time later at the FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bimini" title="Bimini">Bimini</a>. He assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to show him the same courtesy, which she says she cannot do. Lecter then hangs up the phone, saying he's "having an old friend for dinner", and begins following a newly arrived Chilton, who is fleeing since Lecter is at large.</p>
