She had not had any previous acting experience, and the 11-year-old actress went directly from her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland" title="Auckland">Auckland</a> school classroom to the film set when the shoot began in New Zealand, in late 2001. Castle-Hughes received widespread critical acclaim for her performance and the film turned her into an international <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity" title="Celebrity">celebrity</a>.

Although she did not win the Best Actress award, she became the youngest person nominated in this category and the first Polynesian ever nominated.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She soon followed the role by appearing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_(musician)" title="Prince (musician)">Prince</a>'s controversial music video for his song "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamon_Girl_(Prince_song)" title="Cinnamon Girl (Prince song)">Cinnamon Girl</a>" and with a shoot in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i> magazine.

O. Scott said that she "seemed entirely unfazed by the demands of playing Mary. She had the poise and intelligence to play the character not as an icon of maternity, but rather as a headstrong, thoughtful adolescent transformed by an unimaginable responsibility." The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christian</a>-themed film earned only $8 million during its opening week, but its box office surged during the week of Christmas,. Overall, it made approximately $44.3 million USD. One critic later speculated: "It may have been harmed by the fact that its leading lady, Keisha Castle-Hughes, was found to be unwed and pregnant just as the movie's publicity campaign began."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2007 Castle-Hughes appeared in Australian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy-drama" title="Comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey,_Hey,_It%27s_Esther_Blueburger" title="Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger">Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger</a></i>, which was filmed in late 2006.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>Whale Rider</b></i> is a 2002 New Zealand drama film directed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niki_Caro" title="Niki Caro">Niki Caro</a>, based on the novel of the same name by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witi_Ihimaera" title="Witi Ihimaera">Witi Ihimaera</a>. The film stars <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keisha_Castle-Hughes" title="Keisha Castle-Hughes">Keisha Castle-Hughes</a> as Kahu Paikea Apirana, a 12-year-old girl struggling to become the chief of the tribe. Her grandfather Koro believes that this is a role reserved for males only.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a co-production between New Zealand and Germany. It was shot on location in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whangara" title="Whangara">Whangara</a>, the setting of the novel.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The world premiere was on 9 September 2002, at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_International_Film_Festival" title="Toronto International Film Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. The film received critical acclaim upon its release. Castle-Hughes was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film's plot follows the story of Paikea Apirana ("Pai"), a 12-year-old girl who is the only living child in the line of the tribe's chiefly succession following the death of her twin brother and mother when she was born. By tradition, the leader should be the first-born son â€” a direct <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrilineal" title="Patrilineal">patrilineal</a> descendant of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paikea" title="Paikea">Paikea</a>, the Whale Rider â€” he who rode atop a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale" title="Whale">whale</a> from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiki" title="Hawaiki">Hawaiki</a>. However, Pai is female and technically cannot inherit the leadership.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Koro decides to form a cultural school for the village boys, hoping to find a new leader. He teaches the boys to use a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiaha" title="Taiaha">taiaha</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_stick" title="Fighting stick">fighting stick</a>). This is traditionally reserved for males. However, Nanny tells Pai that her second son, Pai's uncle, had won a taiaha tournament in his youth while he was still slim, so Pai secretly learns from him. She also secretly follows Koro's lessons. One of the students, Hemi, is also sympathetic towards her, but Koro is enraged when he finds out, particularly when she wins her taiaha fight against Hemi. Koro's relationship with Pai erodes further when none of the boys succeed at the traditional task of recovering the rei puta (whale tooth) that he threw into the ocean â€” this mission would prove one of them worthy of becoming leader.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pai, in an attempt to bridge the rift that has formed, invites Koro to be her guest of honour at a concert of MÄ&#129;ori chants that her school is putting on. Unknown to all, she had won an inter-school speech contest with a touching dedication to Koro and the traditions of the village. However, Koro was late, and as he was walking to the school, he notices that numerous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_whale" title="Right whale">right whales</a> are beached near Pai's home. The entire village attempts to coax and drag them back into the water, but all efforts prove unsuccessful; even a tractor doesn't help because the rope breaks. Koro sees it as a sign of his failure and despairs further. He admonishes Pai against touching the largest whale because "she has done enough damage" with her presumption. Also, the largest whale traditionally belongs to the legendary Paikea. But when Koro walks away, she climbs onto the back of the largest whale and coaxes it to re-enter the ocean. The whale leads the entire pod back into the sea; Paikea nearly drowns in the process. When she goes out to sea, Nanny Flowers shows Koro the whale tooth which Pai had previously recovered. When Pai is found and brought to the hospital, Koro declares her the leader and asks her forgiveness. The film ends with the village, including Pai's father, uncle, and grandparents, celebrating her status as leader, as the finished <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_(canoe)" title="Waka (canoe)">waka</a> is hauled into the sea for its maiden voyage.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film had budget of NZ$9,235,000. It received $2.5 million from the New Zealand Film Production Fund.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Casting director Diana Rowan visited numerous schools to find an actress to play Pai. 10,000 children were auditioned before narrowing it down to 12. Castle-Hughes impressed Caro in the resulting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_workshop" title="Acting workshop">workshop</a> and was cast as Pai.</p>

Producer John Barnett said "This novel was set in Whangara and it would almost have been heresy to shoot anywhere else. There are very physical things that are described in the book - the sweep of the bay, the island that looks like a whale, the meeting houses, the number of houses that are present and of course, the people whose legend we were telling. [...] If we'd gone somewhere else and tried to manufacture the surroundings and the ambience, then I think it would have been noticeable in the picture."</p>
