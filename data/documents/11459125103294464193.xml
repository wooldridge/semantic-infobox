	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, the son of Peggy (nÃ©e Barnsley) and Lindsay Weir, a real estate agent. Weir attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scots_College" title="The Scots College">The Scots College</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaucluse_High_School" title="Vaucluse High School">Vaucluse Boys' High School</a> before studying <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art" title="Art">art</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law" title="Law">law</a> at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" title="University of Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. His interest in film was sparked by his meeting with fellow students, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Noyce" title="Phillip Noyce">Phillip Noyce</a> and the future members of the Sydney filmmaking collective <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubu_Films" title="Ubu Films">Ubu Films</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After leaving university in the mid-1960s he joined Sydney <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> station <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATN-7" title="ATN-7">ATN-7</a>, where he worked as a production assistant on the groundbreaking satirical comedy program <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mavis_Bramston_Show" title="The Mavis Bramston Show">The Mavis Bramston Show</a></i>. During this period, using station facilities, he made his first two experimental short films, <i>Count Vim's Last Exercise</i> and <i>The Life and Flight of Reverend Buckshotte</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir then took up a position with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Film_Unit" title="Commonwealth Film Unit">Commonwealth Film Unit</a> (later renamed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Australia" title="Film Australia">Film Australia</a>), for which he made several documentaries, including a short documentary about an underprivileged outer Sydney suburb, <i>Whatever Happened to Green Valley</i>, in which residents were invited to make their own film segments. Another notable film in this period was the short rock music performance film <i>Three Directions In Australian Pop Music</i> (1972), which featured in-concert colour footage of three of the most significant Melbourne rock acts of the period, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_(band)" title="Spectrum (band)">Spectrum</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Captain_Matchbox_Whoopee_Band" title="The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band">The Captain Matchbox Whoopee Band</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy_Saddington" title="Wendy Saddington">Wendy Saddington</a>. He also directed one section of the three-part, three-director feature film <i>Three To Go</i> (1970), which won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Film_Institute" title="Australian Film Institute">AFI award</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After leaving the CFU, Weir made his first major independent film, the short feature <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesdale" title="Homesdale">Homesdale</a></i> (1971), an offbeat black comedy which co-starred rising young actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Fitzpatrick" title="Kate Fitzpatrick">Kate Fitzpatrick</a> and musician and comedian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grahame_Bond_(actor)" title="Grahame Bond (actor)">Grahame Bond</a>, who came to fame in 1972 as the star of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Aunty_Jack_Show" title="The Aunty Jack Show">The Aunty Jack Show</a></i>; Weir also played a small role, but this was to be his last significant screen appearance. <i>Homesdale</i> and Weir's two aforementioned CFU shorts have been released on DVD.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's first full-length feature film was the underground cult classic, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cars_That_Ate_Paris" title="The Cars That Ate Paris">The Cars That Ate Paris</a></i> (1975), a low-budget black comedy about the inhabitants of a small country town who deliberately cause fatal car crashes and live off the proceeds. It was a minor success in cinemas but proved very popular on the then-thriving <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-in" title="Drive-in">drive-in</a> circuit.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's major breakthrough in Australia and internationally was the lush, atmospheric period mystery <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic_at_Hanging_Rock_(film)" title="Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)">Picnic at Hanging Rock</a></i> (1975), made with substantial backing from the state-funded <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_Film_Corporation" title="South Australian Film Corporation">South Australian Film Corporation</a> and filmed on location in South Australia and rural Victoria. Based on the novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Lindsay" title="Joan Lindsay">Joan Lindsay</a>, the film relates the purportedly "true" story of a group of students from an exclusive girls' school who mysteriously vanish from a school picnic on Valetine's Day 1900. Widely credited as a key work in the "Australian film renaissance" of the mid-1970s, <i>Picnic</i> was the first Australian film of its era to gain both critical praise and be given substantial international theatrical releases. It also helped launch the career of internationally renowned Australian cinematographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Boyd" title="Russell Boyd">Russell Boyd</a>. It was widely acclaimed by critics, many of whom praised it as a welcome antidote to the so-called "ocker film" genre, typified by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Barry_McKenzie" title="The Adventures of Barry McKenzie">The Adventures of Barry McKenzie</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Purple" title="Alvin Purple">Alvin Purple</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Wave" title="The Last Wave">The Last Wave</a></i> (1977) was a supernatural thriller about a man who begins to experience terrifying visions of an impending natural disaster. It starred the American actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Chamberlain" title="Richard Chamberlain">Richard Chamberlain</a>, who was well-known to Australian and world audiences as the eponymous physician in the popular <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Kildare" title="Doctor Kildare">Doctor Kildare</a></i> TV series, and would later star in the Australian-set major series "The Thorn Birds". <i>The Last Wave</i> was a pensive, ambivalent work that expanded on themes from <i>Picnic</i>, exploring the interactions between the native <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Aborigine" title="Australian Aborigine">Aboriginal</a> and European cultures. It co-starred the aboriginal actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Gulpilil" title="David Gulpilil">David Gulpilil</a>, whose performance won the Golden Ibex (Oscar equivalent) at the Tehran International Festival in 1977 but was only a moderate commercial success at the time.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Between <i>The Last Wave</i> and his next feature, Weir wrote and directed the offbeat low-budget telemovie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plumber" title="The Plumber">The Plumber</a></i> (1979). It starred Australian actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Morris" title="Judy Morris">Judy Morris</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivar_Kants" title="Ivar Kants">Ivar Kants</a> and was filmed in just three weeks. Inspired by a real-life experience told to him by friends, it is a black comedy about a woman whose life is disrupted by an intrusive tradesman (which bears a strong similarity to the 1996 Jim Carrey film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cable_Guy" title="The Cable Guy">The Cable Guy</a></i>).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir scored a major Australian hit and further international praise with his next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_(1981_film)" title="Gallipoli (1981 film)">Gallipoli</a></i> (1981). Scripted by the Australian playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williamson" title="David Williamson">David Williamson</a>, it is regarded as classic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_Australia" title="Cinema of Australia">Australian cinema</a>. <i>Gallipoli</i> was instrumental in making <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a> (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max" title="Mad Max">Mad Max</a></i>) into a major star, although his co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lee_(actor)" title="Mark Lee (actor)">Mark Lee</a>, who also received high praise for his role, has made relatively few screen appearances since.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The climax of Weir's early career was the $6 million multi-national production <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Year_of_Living_Dangerously" title="The Year of Living Dangerously">The Year of Living Dangerously</a></i> (1983), again starring Mel Gibson, playing opposite top Hollywood female lead <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigourney_Weaver" title="Sigourney Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a> in a story about journalistic loyalty, idealism, love and ambition in the turmoil of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukarno" title="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" title="Indonesia">Indonesia</a> of 1965. It was an adaptation of the novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Koch" title="Christopher Koch">Christopher Koch</a>, which was based in part on the experiences of Koch's journalist brother Philip, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Broadcasting_Corporation" title="Australian Broadcasting Corporation">ABC</a>'s Jakarta correspondent and one of the few western journalists in the city during the 1965 attempted coup. The film also won <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Hunt" title="Linda Hunt">Linda Hunt</a> (who played a man in the film) an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On 14 June 1982, Weir was appointed a Member of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia" title="Order of Australia">Order of Australia</a> (AM) for his service to the film industry.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">American film</a> was the successful thriller <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witness_(1985_film)" title="Witness (1985 film)">Witness</a></i> (1985), the first of two films he made with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrison_Ford" title="Harrison Ford">Harrison Ford</a>, a thriller about an Amish boy who sees the murder of an undercover police officer and has to be hidden away in his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish" title="Amish">Amish</a> community to protect him. Child star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lukas_Haas" title="Lukas Haas">Lukas Haas</a> received wide praise for his debut film performance; <i>Witness</i> also earned Weir his first <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Oscar</a> nomination as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Director" title="Academy Award for Best Director">Best Director</a>, and was his first of several films to be nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It was followed by the darker, less commercial <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mosquito_Coast" title="The Mosquito Coast">The Mosquito Coast</a></i> (1986), <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Schrader" title="Paul Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>'s adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Theroux" title="Paul Theroux">Paul Theroux</a>'s novel, with Ford playing a man obsessively pursuing his dream to start a new life in the Central American jungle with his family. These dramatic parts provided Harrison Ford with important opportunities to break the typecasting of his career-making roles in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a></i> series. Both films showed off his ability to play more subtle and substantial characters and he was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his work in <i>Witness</i>, the only Academy Awards recognition in his career. <i>The Mosquito Coast</i> is also notable for an impressive performance by the young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Phoenix" title="River Phoenix">River Phoenix</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Poets_Society" title="Dead Poets Society">Dead Poets Society</a></i> (1989) was a major international success, with Weir again receiving credit for expanding the acting range of its Hollywood star. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> was mainly known for his anarchic standup comedy and his popular TV role as the wisecracking alien in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mork_%26_Mindy" title="Mork &amp; Mindy">Mork &amp; Mindy</a></i>; in this film he played an inspirational teacher in a dramatic story about conformity and rebellion at an exclusive New England <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University-preparatory_school" title="University-preparatory school">prep school</a> in the 1950s. The film was nominated for four Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director for Weir, and launched the acting careers of young actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Hawke" title="Ethan Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sean_Leonard" title="Robert Sean Leonard">Robert Sean Leonard</a>. It became a major box-office hit and is without doubt one of Weir's best-known films for mainstream audiences.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir's first romantic comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Card_(film)" title="Green Card (film)">Green Card</a></i> (1990) was another casting risk. Weir chose French screen icon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9rard_Depardieu" title="GÃ©rard Depardieu">GÃ©rard Depardieu</a> in the leadâ€”Depardieu's first English-language roleâ€”and paired him with American actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andie_MacDowell" title="Andie MacDowell">Andie MacDowell</a>. <i>Green Card</i> was a box-office hit but was regarded as less of a critical success, although it helped Depardieu's path to international fame, and Weir received an Oscar nomination for his original screenplay.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fearless_(1993_film)" title="Fearless (1993 film)">Fearless</a></i> (1993) returned to darker themes and starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bridges" title="Jeff Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a> as a man who believes he has become invincible after surviving a catastrophic air crash. Though well reviewed, particularly the performances of Bridges and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosie_Perez" title="Rosie Perez">Rosie Perez</a> â€” who received an Oscar nomination for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> â€” its unsettling subject matter was less appealing to large audiences than Weir's two preceding films.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After five years, Weir returned to direct his biggest success to date,<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Truman_Show" title="The Truman Show">The Truman Show</a></i> (1998), a bittersweet fantasy-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satire</a> of the media's control of life, later noted to have predated the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_TV" title="Reality TV">reality TV</a> trend begun by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a></i>. <i>The Truman Show</i> was both a box office and a critical smash, receiving glowing reviews and numerous awards, including three Academy Awards nominations, for Best Original Screenplay (by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Niccol" title="Andrew Niccol">Andrew Niccol</a>), Best Supporting Actor (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris" title="Ed Harris">Ed Harris</a>), and Best Director for Weir himself. Again, Weir was noted to have given his star, comedian <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a>, the chance to prove himself in a serious acting role. <i>The Truman Show</i> also included a link to the very beginning of Weir's directorial career: Australian actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Camilleri" title="Terry Camilleri">Terry Camilleri</a>, who starred in his first full-length feature, <i>The Cars That Ate Paris</i>, appears in a cameo role.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2003 Weir returned to period drama with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_and_Commander:_The_Far_Side_of_the_World" title="Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World">Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World</a></i>, starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe" title="Russell Crowe">Russell Crowe</a>.

Despite winning two Oscars (for frequent collaborator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Boyd" title="Russell Boyd">Russell Boyd</a>'s cinematography, and for sound effects editing) and another Best Picture nomination, its audience acceptance ($93 million at the North American Box Office) was moderate, considering the production values and the star power of Crowe. The film grossed slightly better overseas, gleaning an additional $114 million.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1993 Weir spoke about making <i>The Playmaker</i>, a film based on a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Keneally" title="Thomas Keneally">Thomas Keneally</a> book, focusing on the theatre profession in Australia at the turn of the 20th century, but this did not see production.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His films typically involve a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juxtaposition" title="wiktionary:juxtaposition">juxtaposition</a> between <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrocosm_and_microcosm" title="Macrocosm and microcosm">macrocosm and microcosm</a>, depicting the transformation of the central character/s following their introduction to a testing situation. This basic mise-en-scene has been variously enacted in Weir's films through dangerous situations (<i>The Cars That Ate Paris</i>, <i>Gallipoli</i>, <i>Master &amp; Commander</i>), enclosed, constrictive or repressive social milieus (<i>Homesdale</i>, <i>Picnic at Hanging Rock</i>, <i>Dead Poets Society</i>, <i>The Truman Show</i>, <i>Witness</i>), foreign cultures (<i>The Year Of Living Dangerously</i>, <i>Green Card</i>, <i>Mosquito Coast</i>), unfamiliar customs (<i>The Last Wave</i>, <i>Mosquito Coast</i>, <i>Witness</i>), or confrontations with a new way of comprehending the world (<i>The Last Wave</i>, <i>Dead Poets Society</i>, <i>Fearless</i>, <i>The Truman Show</i>).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his international success and celebrity, Weir has a relatively low personal profile; he has maintained close connections with his home city and on several occasions he has returned to Green Valley, the suburb where his early CFU documentary was set. There he has been closely involved in programs designed to teach filmmaking skills to disadvantaged young people. In April 2005 Weir returned to Sydney and reunited with the stars of <i>Gallipoli</i> to celebrate the film's release on DVD.</p>

      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the film's present, during the 30th year "The Truman Show" has been on the air, Truman discovers facts that seem out of place, such as a spotlight from the artificial night sky constellations that nearly hits him (quickly passed off by local radio as an airplane's dislodged landing light) and a "Truman Show" crew conversation on his car radio that is describing his morning commute into work. These events are punctuated by the reappearance of Truman's father, supposedly "dead," onto the set, at first dressed as a hobo. All of this causes Truman to start wondering about his life, realizing much of the town seems to revolve around him. Stress on Meryl to continue her role in spite of Truman's increasing skepticism and attendant hostility causes their marriage to unravel. Truman seeks to get away from Seahaven but is blocked by the inability to arrange for flights, bus breakdowns, sudden masses of traffic, and an apparent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_meltdown" title="Nuclear meltdown">nuclear meltdown</a>. After Meryl breaks down and is taken off the show, Christof officially brings back Truman's father, hoping his presence will keep Truman from trying to leave. However, he only provides a temporary respite: Truman soon becomes isolated and begins staying alone in his basement after Meryl "leaves" him. One night, Truman manages to escape the basement undetected via a secret tunnel, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend broadcasting of the show for the first time in its history. This causes a surge in viewership, with many viewers, including Sylvia, cheering on Truman's escape attempt.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Christof orders every actor and crew member to search the town, breaking the town's daylight cycle to help in the search. They find that Truman has managed to overcome his fear of the water and has been sailing away from the town in a small boat named <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria_(ship)" title="Santa Maria (ship)">Santa Maria</a></i> (the name of the ship in which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus" title="Christopher Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a> discovered the New World). After restoring the broadcast, Christof orders the show's crew to create a large storm to try to capsize the boat. However, Truman's determination eventually leads Christof to terminate the storm. As Truman recovers, the boat reaches the edge of the dome, its bow piercing through the dome's painted sky. An awe-struck Truman then discovers a flight of stairs nearby, leading to a door marked "EXIT". As he contemplates leaving his world, Christof speaks directly to Truman via a powerful sound system, trying to persuade him to stay and arguing that there is no more truth in the real world than there is in his own, artificial world. Truman, after a moment's thought, delivers his catchphrase, <i>"In case I don't see you ... good afternoon, good evening, and good night,"</i> bows to his audience, and steps through the door and into the real world. The assembled television viewers excitedly celebrate Truman's escape, and Sylvia quickly leaves her apartment to reunite with him. A network executive orders the crew to cease transmission. With the show completed, members of Truman's former audience are shown looking for something else to watch.</p>

	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> as Truman Burbank: Chosen out of five unwanted pregnancies and the first child to be legally adopted by a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation" title="Corporation">corporation</a>. He is unaware that his daily life is broadcast 24 hours a day around the world. He has a job in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance" title="Insurance">insurance</a> business and a lovely wife, but he eventually notices that his environment is not what it seems to be. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Williams" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> was considered for the role, but Weir cast Carrey after seeing him in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Ventura:_Pet_Detective" title="Ace Ventura: Pet Detective">Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</a></i> because Carrey's performance reminded him of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chaplin" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>. Carrey took the opportunity to proclaim himself as a dramatic actor, rather than being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting_(acting)" title="Typecasting (acting)">typecast</a> in comedic roles. Carrey, who is normally paid $20 million per film, agreed to do <i>The Truman Show</i> for $12 million. Carrey and Weir initially found working together on set difficult (Carrey's contract gave him the power to demand rewrites), but Weir was impressed with Carrey's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation" title="Improvisation">improvisational</a> skills, and the two became more interactive. The scene where in Truman declares "this planet Trumania of the Burbank galaxy" to the bathroom mirror was Carrey's idea.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Linney" title="Laura Linney">Laura Linney</a> as Meryl/Hannah Gill: Hannah Gill plays Truman's wife, who holds a profession as a nurse at the local hospital. Since the show relies on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_placement" title="Product placement">product placement</a> for revenue, Meryl regularly shows off various items she has recently "purchased," one of the many oddities that makes Truman question his life. Her role is essentially to act the part of Truman's wife and ultimately to have a child by him, despite her reluctance to accomplish either. Linney explains that "she was a child actress who never made it, and now she's really ambitious. Mostly she's into negotiating her contract. Every time she sleeps with Truman she gets an extra $10,000". Linney heavily studied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sears,_Roebuck_and_Company" title="Sears, Roebuck and Company">Sears catalogs</a> from the 1950s to develop her character's poses.</li>

Christof remains dedicated to the program at all costs, often overseeing and directing its course in person (rather than through aides), but at the climax/resolution, he speaks to Truman over a loudspeaker, revealing the nature of Truman's situation. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a> was originally cast in the role, but he left in April 1997 (during filming) over "creative differences." Harris was a last-minute replacement. A number of other actors had turned down the role after Hopper's departure. Harris had an idea of making Christof a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyphosis" title="Kyphosis">hunchback</a>, but Weir did not like the idea.</li>
	<li><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Emmerich" title="Noah Emmerich">Noah Emmerich</a> as Marlon/Louis Coltrane: Louis Coltrane plays Truman's best friend since early childhood. Marlon is a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vending_machine" title="Vending machine">vending machine</a> operator for the company Goodies, who promises Truman he would never lie to him, despite the latest events in Truman's life. Emmerich has said, "My character is in a lot of pain. He feels really guilty about deceiving Truman. He's had a serious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_addiction" title="Drug addiction">drug addiction</a> for many years.

She became romantically involved with Truman and tried to reveal to him the truth about his life, but she was thrown out of the show before she could do so. Thereafter, she strongly protests against <i>The Truman Show</i>, urging Christof to release its lead.</li>

When Truman was a boy, his character on the show was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that would prevent Truman from leaving the set; however, he kept sneaking back into the show time and again.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Niccol" title="Andrew Niccol">Andrew Niccol</a> completed a one-page <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_treatment" title="Film treatment">film treatment</a> titled <i>The Malcolm Show</i> in May 1991. The original draft was more in tone of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction_film" title="Science fiction film">science fiction</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thriller_(genre)" title="Thriller (genre)">thriller</a>, with the story set in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>. Niccol stated, "I think everyone questions the authenticity of their lives at certain points. It's like when kids ask if they're adopted". In the fall of 1993, producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Rudin" title="Scott Rudin">Scott Rudin</a> purchased the script for slightly over $1 million. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> instantly agreed to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_distributor" title="Film distributor">distribute</a>. Part of the deal called for Niccol to have his directing debut, though Paramount felt the estimated $80 million budget would be too high for him. In addition, Paramount wanted to go with an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list" title="A-list">A-list</a> director, paying Niccol extra money "to step aside." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_De_Palma" title="Brian De Palma">Brian De Palma</a> was under negotiations to direct before he left <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Talent_Agency" title="United Talent Agency">United Talent Agency</a> in March 1994.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Paramount was cautious about <i>The Truman Show</i> which they dubbed "the most expensive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_film" title="Art film">art film</a> ever made" because of its $60 million budget. They wanted the film to be funnier and less dramatic. Weir also shared this vision, feeling that Niccol's script was too dark, and declaring "where he [Niccol] had it depressing, I could make it light. It could convince audiences they could watch a show in this scope 24/7." Niccol wrote sixteen drafts of the script before Weir considered the script ready for filming. Later on in 1995, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Carrey" title="Jim Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> signed to star, but because of commitments with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cable_Guy" title="The Cable Guy">The Cable Guy</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar_Liar" title="Liar Liar">Liar Liar</a></i>, he would not be ready to start filming for at least another year. Weir felt Carrey was perfect for the role and opted to wait for another year rather than recast the role. Niccol rewrote the script twelve times, while Weir created a fictionalized book about the show's history. He envisioned backstories for the characters and encouraged actors to do the same.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir scouted locations in Eastern <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a> but was unsatisfied with the landscapes. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_stage" title="Sound stage">Sound stages</a> at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> were reserved for the story's setting of Seahaven before Weir's wife introduced him to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside,_Florida" title="Seaside, Florida">Seaside, Florida</a>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master-planned_community" title="Master-planned community">master-planned community</a> located in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panhandle" title="Florida Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a>.

Other scenes were shot at Paramount Studios in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles, California</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Rockwell" title="Norman Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> paintings and 1960s postcards were used as inspiration for the film's design.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Weir saw <i>The Truman Show</i> as a chance to use the long-abandoned silent-era cinematic technique of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vignetting" title="Vignetting">vignetting</a> the edges of the frame to emphasize the center. The overall look was influenced by television images, particularly commercials: Many shots have characters leaning into the lens with their eyeballs wide open, and the interior scenes are heavily lit, because Weir wanted to remind viewers that "in this world, everything was for sale." Those involved in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects" title="Visual effects">visual effects</a> work found the film somewhat difficult to make, because <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_in_film" title="1997 in film">1997</a> was the year many visual effects companies were trying to convert to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery" title="Computer-generated imagery">computer-generated imagery</a>. CGI was used to create the upper halves of some of the larger buildings in the film's downtown set. Craig Barron, one of the effects supervisors, said that these digital models did not have to look as detailed and weathered as they normally would in a film because of the artificial look of the entire town, although they did imitate slight blemishes found in the physical buildings.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>C.S.

Similarly, one of the workers in the control room wears a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shirt" title="T-shirt">T-shirt</a> that reads, "love him, protect him." Finally, both Truman and the patient leave the world: Truman by walking through a door and the patient by dying. Screwtape described the action in the book by saying, "He got through so easily!

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2008, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Mechanics" title="Popular Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a></i> named <i>The Truman Show</i> as one of the 10 most prophetic science fiction films. Journalist Erik Sofge argued that the story reflects the falseness of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television" title="Reality television">reality television</a>. "Truman simply lives, and the show's popularity is its straightforward voyeurism. And, like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Brother_(TV_series)" title="Big Brother (TV series)">Big Brother</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(TV_series)" title="Survivor (TV series)">Survivor</a></i>, and every other reality show on the air, none of his environment is actually real." He deemed it an eerie coincidence that <i>Big Brother</i> made its debut a year after the film's release, and he also compared the film to the 2003 program <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joe_Schmo_Show" title="The Joe Schmo Show">The Joe Schmo Show</a></i>: "Unlike Truman, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kennedy_Gould" title="Matt Kennedy Gould">Matt Gould</a> could see the cameras, but all of the other contestants were paid actors, playing the part of various reality-show stereotypes. While Matt eventually got all of the prizes in the rigged contest, the show's central running joke was in the same existential ballpark as <i>The Truman Show</i>." Weir declared, "There has always been this question: Is the audience getting dumber? Or are we filmmakers patronizing them? Is this what they want? Or is this what we're giving them? But the public went to my film in large numbers. And that has to be encouraging."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ronald Bishop of <i>Sage Journals Online</i> thought <i>The Truman Show</i> showcased <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_media#Claimed_negative_characteristics_of_mass_media" title="Mass media">the power of the media</a>. Truman's life inspires audiences around the world, meaning their lives are controlled by his. Bishop commented, "In the end, the power of the media is affirmed rather than challenged. In the spirit of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci" title="Antonio Gramsci">Antonio Gramsci</a>'s concept of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemony" title="Hegemony">hegemony</a>, these films and television programs co-opt our enchantment (and disenchantment) with the media and sell it back to us."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An essay published in the <i>International Journal of Psychoanalysis</i> analyzed Truman as</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Parallels can be drawn from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More">Thomas More</a>'s 1516 book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia_(book)" title="Utopia (book)">Utopia</a></i>, in which More describes an island with only one entrance and only one exit. Only those who belonged to this island knew how to navigate their way through the treacherous openings safely and unharmed. This situation is similar to <i>The Truman Show</i> because there are limited entryways into the world that Truman knows. Truman does not belong to this utopia into which he has been implanted, and childhood trauma rendered him frightened of the prospect of ever leaving this small community. Utopian models of the past tended to be full of like-minded individuals who shared much in common, comparable to More's <i>Utopia</i> and real-life groups such as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers" title="Shakers">Shakers</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneida_Community" title="Oneida Community">Oneida Community</a>. It is clear that the people in Truman's world are like-minded in their common effort to keep him oblivious to reality. The suburban "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picket_fence" title="Picket fence">picket fence</a>" appearance of the show's set is reminiscent of the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" title="American Dream">American Dream</a>" of the 1950s. The "American Dream" concept in Truman's world serves to keep him happy and ignorant.</p>
