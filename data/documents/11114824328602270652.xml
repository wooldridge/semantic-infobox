      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>Ruth Elizabeth "Bette" Davis</b> (April 5, 1908Â â€“ October 6, 1989) was an American actress of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film" title="Film">film</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater" title="Theater">theater</a>. Noted for her willingness to play unsympathetic characters, she was highly regarded for her performances in a range of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_genre" title="Film genre">film genres</a>; from contemporary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_film" title="Crime film">crime melodramas</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_film" title="Historical film">historical</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_piece" title="Period piece">period films</a> and occasional <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy" title="Comedy">comedies</a>, though her greatest successes were her roles in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_film" title="Romance film">romantic dramas</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After appearing in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> plays, Davis moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California">Hollywood</a> in 1930, but her early films for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> were unsuccessful. She joined <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> in 1932 and established her career with several critically acclaimed performances. In 1937, she attempted to free herself from her contract and although she lost a well-publicized legal case, it marked the beginning of the most successful period of her career. Until the late 1940s, she was one of American cinema's most celebrated leading ladies, known for her forceful and intense style. Davis gained a reputation as a perfectionist who could be highly combative, and her confrontations with studio executives, film directors and costars were often reported. Her forthright manner, clipped vocal style and ubiquitous <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigarette" title="Cigarette">cigarette</a> contributed to a public persona which has often been imitated and satirized.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis was the co-founder of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Canteen" title="Hollywood Canteen">Hollywood Canteen</a>, and was the first female president of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>. She won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> twice, was the first person to accrue 10 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nominations for acting, and was the first woman to receive a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Life_Achievement_Award" title="AFI Life Achievement Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>. Her career went through several periods of eclipse, and she admitted that her success had often been at the expense of her personal relationships. Married four times, she was once widowed and thrice <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorced</a>, and raised her children as a single parent. Her final years were marred by a long period of ill health, but she continued acting until shortly before her death from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_cancer" title="Breast cancer">breast cancer</a>, with more than 100 films, television and theater roles to her credit. In 1999, Davis was placed second, after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a>, on the American Film Institute's list of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">greatest female stars of all time</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ruth Elizabeth Davis, known from early childhood as "Betty", was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell,_Massachusetts" title="Lowell, Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, the daughter of Ruth ("Ruthie") Augusta (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Married_and_maiden_names" title="Married and maiden names">nÃ©e</a> Favor) and Harlow Morrell Davis, a patent attorney; her sister Barbara ("Bobby") was born October 25, 1909. The family was Protestant, of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_people" title="English people">English</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_people" title="French people">French</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_people" title="Welsh people">Welsh</a> ancestry. In 1915, Davis's parents separated and Betty and Bobby attended a Spartan boarding school called Crestalban in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanesborough,_Massachusetts" title="Lanesborough, Massachusetts">Lanesborough</a>, which is located in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshires" title="Berkshires">Berkshires</a>. In 1921, Ruth Davis moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> with her daughters, where she worked as a portrait photographer. Betty was inspired to become an actress after seeing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino" title="Rudolph Valentino">Rudolph Valentino</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse_(1921_film)" title="The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921 film)">The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a></i> (1921) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Pickford" title="Mary Pickford">Mary Pickford</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Lord_Fauntleroy" title="Little Lord Fauntleroy">Little Lord Fauntleroy</a></i> (1921), and changed the spelling of her name to "Bette" after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honor%C3%A9_de_Balzac" title="HonorÃ© de Balzac">HonorÃ© de Balzac</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Cousine_Bette" title="La Cousine Bette">La Cousine Bette</a></i>. She received encouragement from her mother, who had aspired to become an actress.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing_Academy" title="Cushing Academy">Cushing Academy</a>, a boarding school in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashburnham,_Massachusetts" title="Ashburnham, Massachusetts">Ashburnham, Massachusetts</a>, where she met her future husband, Harmon O. Nelson, known as "Ham". In 1926, she saw a production of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrik_Ibsen" title="Henrik Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wild_Duck" title="The Wild Duck">The Wild Duck</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_Yurka" title="Blanche Yurka">Blanche Yurka</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peg_Entwistle" title="Peg Entwistle">Peg Entwistle</a>. Davis later recalled that it inspired her full commitment to her chosen career, and said, "Before that performance I <i>wanted</i> to be an actress. When it ended, I <i>had</i> to be an actress... exactly like Peg Entwistle.". She auditioned for admission to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_LeGallienne" title="Eva LeGallienne">Eva LeGallienne</a>'s Manhattan Civic Repertory, but was rejected by LeGallienne who described her attitude as "insincere" and "frivolous". She was accepted by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray_Anderson" title="John Murray Anderson">John Murray Anderson</a> School of Theatre, and studied dance with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Graham" title="Martha Graham">Martha Graham</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She auditioned for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cukor" title="George Cukor">George Cukor</a>'s stock theater company, and although he was not very impressed, he gave Davis her first paid acting assignment anywayÂ â€“ a one-week stint playing the part of a chorus girl in the play <i>Broadway</i>. She was later chosen to play Hedwig, the character she had seen Entwistle play, in <i>The Wild Duck</i>. After performing in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston, she made her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> debut in 1929 in <i>Broken Dishes</i>, and followed it with <i>Solid South</i>. A Universal Studios talent scout saw her perform and invited her to Hollywood for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_test" title="Screen test">screen test</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Accompanied by her mother, Davis traveled by train to Hollywood, arriving on December 13, 1930. She later recounted her surprise that nobody from the studio was there to meet her; a studio employee had waited for her, but left because he saw nobody who "looked like an actress". She failed her first screen test but was used in several screen tests for other actors. In a 1971 interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Cavett" title="Dick Cavett">Dick Cavett</a>, she related the experience with the observation, "I was the most Yankee-est, most modest virgin who ever walked the earth. They laid me on a couch, and I tested fifteen menÂ ...Â They all had to lie on top of me and give me a passionate kiss. Oh, I thought I would die. Just thought I would die." A second test was arranged for Davis, for the film <i>A House Divided</i> (1931). Hastily dressed in an ill-fitting costume with a low neckline, she was rebuffed by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_director" title="Film director">director</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wyler" title="William Wyler">William Wyler</a>, who loudly commented to the assembled crew, "What do you think of these dames who show their chests and think they can get jobs?" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle" title="Carl Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>, the head of Universal Studios, considered terminating Davis's employment, but <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematographer" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Freund" title="Karl Freund">Karl Freund</a> told him she had "lovely eyes" and would be suitable for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bad_Sister" title="The Bad Sister">The Bad Sister</a></i> (1931), in which she subsequently made her film debut. Her nervousness was compounded when she overheard the Chief of Production, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Laemmle,_Jr." title="Carl Laemmle, Jr.">Carl Laemmle, Jr.</a>, comment to another executive that she had "about as much sex appeal as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slim_Summerville" title="Slim Summerville">Slim Summerville</a>", one of the film's co-stars. The film was not a success, and her next role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_(1931_film)" title="Seed (1931 film)">Seed</a></i> (1931) was too brief to attract attention.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Universal Studios renewed her contract for three months, and she appeared in a small role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterloo_Bridge_(1931_film)" title="Waterloo Bridge (1931 film)">Waterloo Bridge</a></i> (1931) before being lent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Menace_(film)" title="The Menace (film)">The Menace</a></i> and to Capital Films for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell%27s_House" title="Hell's House">Hell's House</a></i> (all 1932). After nine months, and six unsuccessful films, Laemmle elected not to renew her contract. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Arliss" title="George Arliss">George Arliss</a> chose Davis for the lead female role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Played_God" title="The Man Who Played God">The Man Who Played God</a></i> (1932), and for the rest of her life, Davis credited him with helping her achieve her "break" in Hollywood. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saturday_Evening_Post" title="The Saturday Evening Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a></i> wrote, "she is not only beautiful, but she bubbles with charm", and compared her to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Bennett" title="Constance Bennett">Constance Bennett</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_Borden" title="Olive Borden">Olive Borden</a>. Warner Bros. signed her to a five-year contract.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1932, she married Harmon "Ham" Nelson, who was scrutinized by the press; his $100 a week earnings compared unfavorably with Davis's reported $1,000 a week income. Davis addressed the issue in an interview, pointing out that many Hollywood wives earned more than their husbands, but the situation proved difficult for Nelson, who refused to allow Davis to purchase a house until he could afford to pay for it himself.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After more than 20Â film roles, the role of the vicious and slatternly Mildred Rogers in the RKO Radio production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Human_Bondage_(1934_film)" title="Of Human Bondage (1934 film)">Of Human Bondage</a></i> (1934), a film adaptation of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Somerset_Maugham" title="W. Somerset Maugham">W. Somerset Maugham</a>'s novel, earned Davis her first major critical acclaim. Many actresses feared playing unsympathetic characters and several had refused the role, but Davis viewed it as an opportunity to show the range of her acting skills. Her costar, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Howard_(actor)" title="Leslie Howard (actor)">Leslie Howard</a>, was initially dismissive of her, but as filming progressed his attitude changed and he subsequently spoke highly of her abilities. The director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cromwell_(director)" title="John Cromwell (director)">John Cromwell</a>, allowed her relative freedom, and commented, "I let Bette have her head. I trusted her instincts." She insisted that she be portrayed realistically in her death scene, and said, "the last stages of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubercolosis" title="Tubercolosis">consumption</a>, poverty and neglect are not pretty and I intended to be convincing-looking".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was a success, and Davis's confronting characterization won praise from critics, with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_(magazine)" title="Life (magazine)">Life</a></i> magazine writing that she gave "probably the best performance ever recorded on the screen by a U.S. actress". Davis anticipated that her reception would encourage Warner Bros. to cast her in more important roles, and was disappointed when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner" title="Jack Warner">Jack Warner</a> refused to lend her to Columbia Studios to appear in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a></i>, and instead cast her in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodrama</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housewife_(film)" title="Housewife (film)">Housewife</a></i>. When Davis was not nominated for an Academy Award for <i>Of Human Bondage</i>, <i>The Hollywood Citizen News</i> questioned the omission and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a>, herself a nominee, joined a campaign to have Davis nominated. This prompted an announcement from the Academy president, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Estabrook" title="Howard Estabrook">Howard Estabrook</a>, who said that under the circumstances "any voterÂ ...Â may write on the ballot his or her personal choice for the winners", thus allowing, for the only time in the Academy's history, the consideration of a candidate not officially nominated for an award. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> won the award for <i>It Happened One Night</i> but the uproar led to a change in Academy voting procedures the following year, whereby nominations were determined by votes from all eligible members of a particular branch, rather than by a smaller committee, with results independently tabulated by the accounting firm <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_Waterhouse" title="Price Waterhouse">Price Waterhouse</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis appeared in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangerous_(film)" title="Dangerous (film)">Dangerous</a></i> (1935) as a troubled actress and received very good reviews. E. Arnot Robertson wrote in <i>Picture Post</i>, "I think Bette Davis would probably have been burned as a witch if she had lived two or three hundred years ago. She gives the curious feeling of being charged with power which can find no ordinary outlet." <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> hailed her as "becoming one of the most interesting of our screen actresses". She won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> for the role, but commented it was belated recognition for <i>Of Human Bondage</i>, calling the award a "consolation prize". For the rest of her life, Davis maintained that she gave the statue its familiar name of "Oscar" because its posterior resembled that of her husband, whose middle name was Oscar, although her claim has been disputed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, among others.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In her next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Petrified_Forest" title="The Petrified Forest">The Petrified Forest</a></i> (1936), Davis co-starred with Leslie Howard and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphrey_Bogart" title="Humphrey Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>, but Bogart, in his first important role, received most of the critics' praise. Davis appeared in several films over the next two years but most were poorly received.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Convinced that her career was being damaged by a succession of mediocre films, Davis accepted an offer in 1936 to appear in two films in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England" title="England">England</a>. Knowing that she was breaching her contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, she fled to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada" title="Canada">Canada</a> to avoid legal papers being served upon her. Eventually, Davis brought her case to court in England, hoping to get out of her contract with Warner Bros. She later recalled the opening statement of the barrister, Sir <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hastings" title="Patrick Hastings">Patrick Hastings</a>, who represented Warner Bros. Hastings urged the court to "come to the conclusion that this is rather a naughty young lady and that what she wants is more money". He mocked Davis's description of her contract as "slavery" by stating, incorrectly, that she was being paid $1,350 per week. He remarked, "if anybody wants to put me into perpetual servitude on the basis of that remuneration, I shall prepare to consider it". The British press offered little support to Davis, and portrayed her as overpaid and ungrateful.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis explained her viewpoint to a journalist, saying "I knew that, if I continued to appear in any more mediocre pictures, I would have no career left worth fighting for." Davis's counsel presented her complaintsÂ â€“ that she could be suspended without pay for refusing a part, with the period of suspension added to her contract, that she could be called upon to play any part within her abilities regardless of her personal beliefs, that she could be required to support a political party against her beliefs, and that her image and likeness could be displayed in any manner deemed applicable by the studio. Jack Warner testified, and was asked, "Whatever part you choose to call upon her to play, if she thinks she can play it, whether it is distasteful and cheap, she has to play it?" Warner replied, "Yes, she must play it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The case, decided by Branson J. in the English High Court, was reported as <i>Warner Bros. Studios Incorporated v. Nelson</i> in [1937] 1 KB 209. Davis lost the case and returned to Hollywood, in debt and without income, to resume her career. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> mounted a similar case in 1943 and won.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis began work on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marked_Woman" title="Marked Woman">Marked Woman</a></i> (1937), as a prostitute in a contemporary gangster drama inspired by the case of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luciano" title="Lucky Luciano">Lucky Luciano</a>. The film and Davis's performance received excellent reviews, and her stature as a leading actress was enhanced.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the filming of her next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel_(film)" title="Jezebel (film)">Jezebel</a></i> (1938), Davis entered a relationship with director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wyler" title="William Wyler">William Wyler</a>. She later described him as the "love of my life", and said that making the film with him was "the time in my life of my most perfect happiness". The film was a success, and Davis's performance as a spoiled <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_belle" title="Southern belle">Southern belle</a> earned her a second Academy Award, which led to speculation in the press that she would be chosen to play a similar character, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara" title="Scarlett O'Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a>, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>. Davis expressed her desire to play Scarlett, and while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a> was conducting a search for the actress to play the role, a radio poll named her as the audience favorite. Warner offered her services to Selznick as part of a deal that also included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> and Olivia de Havilland, but Selznick did not consider Davis as suitable, and rejected the offer.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Jezebel</i> marked the beginning of the most successful phase of Davis's career, and over the next few years she was listed in the annual "Quigley Poll of the Top Ten Money Making Stars", which was compiled from the votes of movie exhibitors throughout the U.S. for the stars that had generated the most revenue in their theaters over the previous year. In contrast to Davis's success, her husband, Ham Nelson, had failed to establish a career for himself, and their relationship faltered. In 1938, Nelson obtained evidence that Davis was engaged in a sexual relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a> and subsequently filed for divorce citing Davis's "cruel and inhuman manner".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She was emotional during the making of her next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Victory" title="Dark Victory">Dark Victory</a></i> (1939), and considered abandoning it until the producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_B._Wallis" title="Hal B. Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a> convinced her to channel her despair into her acting. The film became one of the highest grossing films of the year, and the role of Judith Traherne brought her an Academy Award nomination. In later years, Davis cited this performance as her personal favorite.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She appeared in three other box office hits in 1939, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Maid_(1939_film)" title="The Old Maid (1939 film)">The Old Maid</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juarez_(1939_film)" title="Juarez (1939 film)">Juarez</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Muni" title="Paul Muni">Paul Muni</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Lives_of_Elizabeth_and_Essex" title="The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex">The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex</a></i> with Errol Flynn. The latter was her first color film and her only color film made during the height of her career. To play the elderly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_I_of_England" title="Elizabeth I of England">Elizabeth I of England</a>, Davis shaved her hairline and eyebrows. During filming she was visited on the set by the actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>. She commented that she had a "nerve" playing a woman in her sixties, to which Laughton replied, "Never not dare to hang yourself. That's the only way you grow in your profession. You must continually attempt things that you think are beyond you, or you get into a complete rut." Recalling the episode many years later, Davis remarked that Laughton's advice had influenced her throughout her career.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By this time, Davis was Warner Bros.' most profitable star, and she was given the most important of their female leading roles. Her image was considered with more care; although she continued to play character roles, she was often filmed in close-ups that emphasized her distinctive eyes. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_This_and_Heaven_Too" title="All This and Heaven Too">All This and Heaven Too</a></i> (1940) was the most financially successful film of Davis's career to that point, while <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Letter_(1940_film)" title="The Letter (1940 film)">The Letter</a></i> (1940) was considered "one of the best pictures of the year" by <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i>, and Davis won admiration for her portrayal of an adulterous killer, a role originated by famed actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cornell" title="Katharine Cornell">Katharine Cornell</a>. During this time, she was in a relationship with her former costar <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brent" title="George Brent">George Brent</a>, who proposed marriage. Davis refused, as she had met Arthur Farnsworth, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> innkeeper. They were married in December 1940.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 1941, Davis became the first female president of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences" title="Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> but antagonized the committee members with her brash manner and radical proposals. Faced with the disapproval and resistance of the committee, Davis resigned, and was succeeded by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Hersholt" title="Jean Hersholt">Jean Hersholt</a>, who implemented the changes she had suggested.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">William Wyler directed Davis in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Hellman" title="Lillian Hellman">Lillian Hellman</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Foxes_(film)" title="The Little Foxes (film)">The Little Foxes</a></i> ( RKO,1941), but they clashed over the character of Regina Giddens. Taking a role originally played on stage by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead" title="Tallulah Bankhead">Tallulah Bankhead</a>, Davis felt Bankhead's original interpretation was appropriate and followed Hellman's intent, but Wyler wanted her to soften the character. Davis refused to compromise. She received another Academy Award nomination for her performance, and never worked with Wyler again.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor" title="Attack on Pearl Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Davis spent the early months of 1942 selling <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_bonds" title="War bonds">war bonds</a>. After Jack Warner criticized her tendency to cajole crowds into buying, she reminded him that her audiences responded most strongly to her "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitch_(insult)" title="Bitch (insult)">bitch</a>" performances. She sold two million dollars of bonds in two days, as well as a picture of herself in <i>Jezebel</i> for $250,000. She also performed for black regiments as the only white member of an acting troupe formed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel" title="Hattie McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>, that also included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Horne" title="Lena Horne">Lena Horne</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Waters" title="Ethel Waters">Ethel Waters</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Garfield" title="John Garfield">John Garfield</a>'s suggestion of opening a servicemen's club in Hollywood, Davisâ€“with the aid of Warner, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jule_Styne" title="Jule Styne">Jule Styne</a>â€“transformed an old nightclub into the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Canteen" title="Hollywood Canteen">Hollywood Canteen</a>, which opened on October 3, 1942. Hollywood's most important stars volunteered to entertain servicemen. Davis ensured that every night there would be a few important "names" for the visiting soldiers to meet. She appeared as herself in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Canteen_(1944_film)" title="Hollywood Canteen (1944 film)">Hollywood Canteen</a></i> (1944) which used the canteen as the setting for a fictional story. Davis later commented, "There are few accomplishments in my life that I am sincerely proud of. The Hollywood Canteen is one of them." In 1980, she was awarded the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defense_Distinguished_Civilian_Service_Award" title="Department of Defense Distinguished Civilian Service Award">Distinguished Civilian Service Medal</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>'s highest civilian award, for her work with the Hollywood Canteen.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis had initially shown little interest in the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Now,_Voyager" title="Now, Voyager">Now, Voyager</a></i> (1942) until <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Wallis" title="Hal Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> advised her that female audiences needed romantic dramas to distract them from the reality of their lives. It became one of the best known of her 'women's pictures'. In one of the film's most imitated scenes <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Henreid" title="Paul Henreid">Paul Henreid</a> lights two cigarettes as they are held in his lips before passing one to Davis. Film reviewers complimented Davis on her performance, the <i>National Board of Review</i> commenting that she gave the film "a dignity not fully warranted by the script".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During the early 1940s, several of Davis's film choices were influenced by the war, such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watch_on_the_Rhine" title="Watch on the Rhine">Watch on the Rhine</a></i> (1943) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_Your_Lucky_Stars_(1943_film)" title="Thank Your Lucky Stars (1943 film)">Thank Your Lucky Stars</a></i> (1943), a lighthearted all-star musical <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalcade" title="Cavalcade">cavalcade</a>, with each of the featured stars donating their fee to the Hollywood Canteen. Davis performed a novelty song, "They're Either Too Young or Too Old", which became a hit record after the film's release.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Acquaintance" title="Old Acquaintance">Old Acquaintance</a></i> (1943) reunited her with Miriam Hopkins in a story of two old friends who deal with the tensions created when one of them becomes a successful novelist. Davis felt that Hopkins tried to upstage her throughout the film. The director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Sherman" title="Vincent Sherman">Vincent Sherman</a> recalled the intense competitiveness and animosity between the two actresses, and Davis often joked that she held back nothing in a scene in which she was required to shake Hopkins in a fit of anger.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In August 1943, Davis's husband, Arthur Farnsworth, collapsed while walking along a Hollywood street, and died two days later. An <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autopsy" title="Autopsy">autopsy</a> revealed that his fall had been caused by a skull fracture which had occurred about two weeks earlier. Davis testified before an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest" title="Inquest">inquest</a> that she knew of no event that might have caused the injury. A finding of accidental death was reached. Highly distraught, Davis attempted to withdraw from her next film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Skeffington" title="Mr. Skeffington">Mr. Skeffington</a></i> (1944), but Jack Warner, who had halted production following Farnsworth's death, convinced her to continue.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although she had gained a reputation for being forthright and demanding, her behavior during filming of <i>Mr. Skeffington</i> was erratic and out of character. She alienated director Vincent Sherman by refusing to film certain scenes and insisting that some sets be rebuilt. She improvised dialogue, causing confusion among other actors, and infuriated the writer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_J._Epstein" title="Julius J. Epstein">Julius Epstein</a>, who was also called upon to rewrite scenes at her whim. Davis later explained her actions with the observation, "when I was most unhappy I lashed out rather than whined". Some reviewers criticized Davis for the excess of her performance; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a> wrote that she "demonstrates the horrors of egocentricity on a marathonic scale", but despite the mixed reviews, she received another Academy Award nomination.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis married an artist, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Grant_Sherry" title="William Grant Sherry">William Grant Sherry</a>, who also, when necessary, worked as a masseur, in 1945. She had been drawn to him because he claimed that he had never heard of her and was therefore not intimidated by her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis refused the title role in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mildred_Pierce_(film)" title="Mildred Pierce (film)">Mildred Pierce</a></i> (1945), a role for which <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> ultimately won an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>, and instead made <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corn_Is_Green_(1945_film)" title="The Corn Is Green (1945 film)">The Corn Is Green</a></i> (1945) based on a play by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emlyn_Williams" title="Emlyn Williams">Emlyn Williams</a>. Davis played Miss Moffat, an English teacher who saves a young <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales" title="Wales">Welsh</a> miner from a life in the coal pits, by offering him education. The part had originally been played in the theatre by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethel_Barrymore" title="Ethel Barrymore">Ethel Barrymore</a> but Warner Bros. felt that the film version should depict the character as a younger woman. Davis disagreed and insisted on playing the part as written and wore a gray wig and padding under her clothes to create a dowdy appearance. The film was well received by critics and made a profit of $2.2 million. The critic E. Arnot Robinson observed that "only Bette Davis... could have combated so successfully the obvious intention of the adaptors of the play to make frustrated sex the mainspring of the chief character's interest in the young miner." He concluded that "the subtle interpretation she insisted on giving" kept the focus on the teacher's "sheer joy in imparting knowledge".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Stolen_Life" title="A Stolen Life">A Stolen Life</a></i> (1946), was the first and only film that Davis made with her own production company, BD Productions. Davis played dual roles, as twins. The film received poor reviews, and was described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> as "a distressingly empty piece", but was one of her biggest box-office successes with a profit of $2.5 million. In 1947, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Treasury" title="U.S. Treasury">U.S. Treasury</a> named Davis as the highest paid woman in the country, with her share of the film's profit accounting for most of her earnings. Her next film was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_(1946_film)" title="Deception (1946 film)">Deception</a></i> (1946), the first of her films to lose money.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessed_(1947_film)" title="Possessed (1947 film)">Possessed</a></i> (1947) had been tailor-made for Davis and was to have been her next project after <i>Deception</i>. However, she was pregnant and went on maternity leave. Joan Crawford played her role in <i>Possessed</i> and was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress. In 1947, at the age of 39, Davis gave birth to a daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._D._Hyman" title="B. D. Hyman">Barbara Davis Sherry</a> (known as B.D.) and later wrote in her memoir that she became absorbed in motherhood and considered ending her career. Her relationship with Sherry began to deteriorate and she continued making films, but her popularity with audiences was steadily declining.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Among the film roles offered to Davis following her return to film making was Rose Sayer in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African_Queen_(film)" title="The African Queen (film)">The African Queen</a></i> (1951). When informed that the film was to be made in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, Davis refused the part, telling Jack Warner, "If you can't shoot the picture in a boat on the back lot, then I'm not interested." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> played the role. Davis was also offered a role in a film version of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Kellogg" title="Virginia Kellogg">Virginia Kellogg</a> prison drama <i>Women Without Men.</i> Originally intended to pair Davis with Joan Crawford, Davis made it clear that she would not appear in any "dyke movie", and the lead roles were played by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_Parker" title="Eleanor Parker">Eleanor Parker</a> when it was filmed as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caged" title="Caged">Caged</a></i> (1950). She lobbied Jack Warner to make two films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethan_Frome" title="Ethan Frome">Ethan Frome</a></i> and a biography of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Todd_Lincoln" title="Mary Todd Lincoln">Mary Todd Lincoln</a>, however Warner vetoed each proposal.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1948, Davis was cast in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Meeting" title="Winter Meeting">Winter Meeting</a></i> and, although she was initially enthusiastic, she soon learned that Warner had arranged for "softer" lighting to be used to disguise her age. She recalled that she had seen the same lighting technique "on the sets of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Chatterton" title="Ruth Chatterton">Ruth Chatterton</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Francis" title="Kay Francis">Kay Francis</a>, and I knew what they meant". She began to regret accepting the role and, to add to her disappointment, she was not confident in the abilities of her leading man, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Davis_(actor)" title="Jim Davis (actor)">Jim Davis</a>. She disagreed with amendments made to the script because of censorship restrictions and found that many of the aspects of the role that had initially appealed to her were no longer to be included. The film was later described by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> as "interminable" and he noted that "of all the miserable dilemmas in which Miss Davis has been involvedÂ ...Â this one is probably the worst". It failed at the box office and the studio lost nearly one million dollars.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis clashed with her co-star <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a> while making <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/June_Bride" title="June Bride">June Bride</a></i> (1948), later describing him as "a male Miriam Hopkins... an excellent actor, but addicted to scene-stealing". The film marked her first comedy in several years, and earned her some positive reviews, but it was not particularly popular with audiences and returned only a small profit. Despite the lackluster box office receipts from her more recent films, in 1949, she negotiated a four-film contract with Warner Bros. which paid $10,285 per week and made her the highest-paid woman in the United States.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Jack Warner refused to allow her script approval and cast her in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_the_Forest" title="Beyond the Forest">Beyond the Forest</a></i> (1949). Davis reportedly loathed the script and begged Warner to recast the role, but he refused. After the film was completed, Warner released Davis from her contract, at her request. The reviews that followed were scathing; Dorothy Manners writing for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Examiner" title="Los Angeles Examiner">Los Angeles Examiner</a></i> described the film as "an unfortunate finale to her brilliant career". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a> wrote, "If Bette had deliberately set out to wreck her career, she could not have picked a more appropriate vehicle." The film contained the line, "What a dump!", which became closely associated with Davis after impersonators used it in their acts. In later years, Davis often used it as her opening line at speaking engagements.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By 1949, Davis and Sherry were estranged and Hollywood columnists were writing that Davis's career was at an end. She filmed <i>The Story of a Divorce</i> (released by RKO Radio Pictures in 1951 as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_on_Demand" title="Payment on Demand">Payment on Demand</a></i>) but had received no other offers. Shortly before filming was completed, the producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" title="Darryl F. Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> offered her the role of the aging theatrical actress Margo Channing in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_About_Eve" title="All About Eve">All About Eve</a></i> (1950). <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>, for whom the part had been written, had severely injured her back, and although production had been halted for two months in the hope that she might recover, she was unable to continue. Davis read the script, described it as the best she had ever read, and accepted the role. Within days she joined the cast in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> to begin filming. During production, she established what would become a life-long friendship with her costar, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Baxter" title="Anne Baxter">Anne Baxter</a>, and a romantic relationship with her leading man, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Merrill" title="Gary Merrill">Gary Merrill</a>, which led to marriage. The film's director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_L._Mankiewicz" title="Joseph L. Mankiewicz">Joseph L. Mankiewicz</a> later remarked, "Bette was letter perfect. She was syllable-perfect. The director's dream: the prepared actress."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Critics responded positively to Davis's performance and several of her lines became well-known, particularly, "Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night." She was again nominated for an Academy Award and critics such as Gene Ringgold described her Margo as her "all-time best performance". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael" title="Pauline Kael">Pauline Kael</a> wrote that much of Mankiewicz's vision of "the theater" was "nonsense" but commended Davis, writing "[the film is] saved by one performance that is the real thing: Bette Davis is at her most instinctive and assured.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On July 3, 1950 Davis's divorce from William Sherry was finalized, and on July 28 she married Gary Merrill. With Sherry's consent, Merrill adopted B.D., Davis's daughter with Sherry, and in 1950, Davis and Merrill adopted a baby girl they named Margot. The family traveled to England, where Davis and Merrill starred in a murder-mystery film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_Man%27s_Poison" title="Another Man's Poison">Another Man's Poison</a></i> (1951). When it received lukewarm reviews and failed at the box office, Hollywood columnists wrote that Davis's comeback had petered out, and an Academy Award nomination for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_(1952_film)" title="The Star (1952 film)">The Star</a></i> (1952) did not halt her decline.</p>

She was uncomfortable working outside of her area of expertise; she had never been a musical performer and her limited theater experience had been more than 20Â years earlier. She was also severely ill and was operated on for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteomyelitis" title="Osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a> of the jaw. Margot was diagnosed as severely brain damaged due to an injury sustained during or shortly after her birth, and was eventually placed in an institution.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Few of Davis's films of the 1950s were successful and many of her performances were condemned by critics. <i>The Hollywood Reporter</i> wrote of mannerisms "that you'd expect to find in a nightclub impersonation of [Davis]", while the London critic, Richard Winninger, wrote, "Miss Davis, with more say than most stars as to what films she makes, seems to have lapsed into egoism. The criterion for her choice of film would appear to be that nothing must compete with the full display of each facet of the Davis art. Only bad films are good enough for her." As her career declined, her marriage continued to deteriorate until she filed for divorce in 1960. The following year, her mother died.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1961, Davis opened in the Broadway production <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_Iguana" title="The Night of the Iguana">The Night of the Iguana</a></i> to mostly mediocre reviews, and left the production after four months due to "chronic illness".

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis and Joan Crawford played two aging sisters, former actresses forced by circumstance to share a decaying Hollywood mansion. The director, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Aldrich" title="Robert Aldrich">Robert Aldrich</a>, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers and commented, "It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly." After filming was completed, their public comments against each other allowed the tension to develop into a lifelong feud, and when Davis was nominated for an Academy Award, Crawford campaigned against her. Davis also received her only <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts" title="British Academy of Film and Television Arts">BAFTA Award</a> nomination for this performance.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Daughter B.D. played a small role in the film and when she and Davis visited the Cannes Film Festival to promote it, she met Jeremy Hyman, an executive for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Arts_Productions" title="Seven Arts Productions">Seven Arts Productions</a>. After a short courtship, she married Hyman at the age of 16, with Davis's permission.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September 1962, Davis placed an advertisement in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> under the heading of "Situations wantedÂ â€” women artists", which read, "Mother of threeâ€”10, 11 &amp; 15â€”divorcee. American. Thirty years experience as an actress in Motion Pictures. Mobile still and more affable than rumor would have it. Wants steady employment in Hollywood. (Has had Broadway)."

Davis played the mother of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Hayward" title="Susan Hayward">Susan Hayward</a> but filming was hampered by heated arguments between Davis and Hayward. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush..._Hush,_Sweet_Charlotte" title="Hush...

A <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_episode" title="Pilot episode">pilot episode</a> was filmed, but was not shown, and the project was terminated.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the early 1970s, Davis was invited to appear in New York, in a stage presentation, <i>Great Ladies of the American Cinema.</i> Over five successive nights, a different female star discussed her career and answered questions from the audience; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Russell" title="Rosalind Russell">Rosalind Russell</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Sidney" title="Sylvia Sidney">Sylvia Sidney</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> were the other participants.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1972, she played the lead role in two television films that were each intended as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_pilot" title="Television pilot">pilots</a> for upcoming series for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madame_Sin" title="Madame Sin">Madame Sin</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wagner" title="Robert Wagner">Robert Wagner</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Judge_and_Jake_Wyler" title="The Judge and Jake Wyler">The Judge and Jake Wyler</a>,</i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Van_Ark" title="Joan Van Ark">Joan Van Ark</a>, but in each case, NBC decided against producing a series.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the U.S., she appeared in the stage production, <i>Miss Moffat,</i> a musical adaptation of <i>The Corn is Green,</i> but after the show was panned by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> critics during its pre-Broadway run, she cited a back injury and abandoned the show, which closed immediately.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, Davis became the first woman to receive the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Life_Achievement_Award" title="AFI Life Achievement Award">Lifetime Achievement Award</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the telecast she found herself in demand again, often having to choose between several offers.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several of Davis's friends commented that Hyman's depictions of events were not accurate; one said, "so much of the book is out of context". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Wallace_(journalist)" title="Mike Wallace (journalist)">Mike Wallace</a> rebroadcast a <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60_Minutes" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> interview he had filmed with Hyman a few years earlier in which she commended Davis on her skills as a mother, and said that she had adopted many of Davis's principles in raising her own children. Critics of Hyman noted that Davis had financially supported the Hyman family for several years and had recently saved them from losing their house. Despite the acrimony of their divorce years earlier, Gary Merrill also defended Davis. Interviewed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN" title="CNN">CNN</a>, Merrill said that Hyman was motivated by "cruelty and greed". Davis's adopted son, Michael Merrill, ended contact with Hyman and refused to speak to her again, as did Davis, who also disinherited her.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In her second memoir, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_%27N_That" title="This 'N That">This 'N That</a></i> (1987), Davis wrote, "I am still recovering from the fact that a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as "Hyman", and described her actions as "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success."</p>

The film earned good reviews, with one critic writing, "Bette crawls across the screen like a testy old hornet on a windowpane, snarling, staggering, twitchingÂ â€“ a symphony of misfired synapses."

On her tombstone is written: "She did it the hard way", an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph" title="Epitaph">epitaph</a> that she mentioned in her memoir <i>Mother Goddam</i> as having been suggested to her by Joseph L. Mankiewicz shortly after they had filmed <i>All About Eve.</i></p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1997, the executors of her estate, Michael Merrill, her son, and Kathryn Sermak, her former assistant, established "The Bette Davis Foundation" which awards college scholarships to promising actors and actresses.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1964, Jack Warner spoke of the "magic quality that transformed this sometimes bland and not beautiful little girl into a great artist", and in a 1988 interview, Davis remarked that, unlike many of her contemporaries, she had forged a career without the benefit of beauty. She admitted she was terrified during the making of her earliest films and that she became tough by necessity. "Until you're known in my profession as a monster, you are not a star", she said, "[but] I've never fought for anything in a treacherous way. I've never fought for anything but the good of the film." During the making of <i>All About Eve,</i> (1950) Joseph L. Mankiewicz told her of the perception in Hollywood that she was difficult, and she explained that when the audience saw her on screen, they did not consider that her appearance was the result of numerous people working behind the scenes. If she was presented as "a horse's ass ... forty feet wide, and thirty feet high", that is all the audience "would see or care about".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">While lauded for her achievements, Davis and her films were sometimes derided; Pauline Kael described <i>Now, Voyager</i> (1942) as a "shlock classic", and by the mid-1940s her sometimes mannered and histrionic performances had become the subject of caricature. Reviewers such as Edwin Schallert for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> praised Davis's performance in <i>Mr. Skeffington</i> (1944), while observing, "the mimics will have more fun than a box of monkeys imitating Miss Davis", and Dorothy Manners writing for the <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i> said of her performance in the poorly received <i>Beyond the Forest,</i> (1949) "no night club caricaturist has ever turned in such a cruel imitation of the Davis mannerisms as Bette turns on herself in this one". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine noted that Davis was compulsively watchable even while criticizing her acting technique, summarizing her performance in <i>Dead Ringer</i> (1964) with the observation, "her acting, as always, isn't really acting: it's shameless showing off. But just try to look away!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">She attracted a following in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_subculture" title="Gay subculture">gay subculture</a> and was frequently imitated by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_impersonator" title="Female impersonator">female impersonators</a> such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Pierce_(female_impersonator)" title="Charles Pierce (female impersonator)">Charles Pierce</a>. Attempting to explain her popularity with gay audiences, the journalist Jim Emerson wrote, "Was she just a camp figurehead because her brittle, melodramatic style of acting hadn't aged well? Or was it that she was 'Larger Than Life,' a tough broad who had survived? Probably some of both."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Her film choices were often unconventional; she sought roles as manipulators and killers in an era when actresses usually preferred to play sympathetic characters, and she excelled in them. She favored authenticity over glamour and was willing to change her own appearance if it suited the character. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a> commented that Davis was the first actress to play roles older than herself, and therefore did not have to make the difficult transition to character parts as she aged.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As she entered old age, Davis was acknowledged for her achievements. John Springer, who had arranged her speaking tours of the early 1970s, wrote that despite the accomplishments of many of her contemporaries, Davis was "<i>the</i> star of the thirties and into the forties", achieving notability for the variety of her characterizations and her ability to assert herself, even when her material was mediocre. Individual performances continued to receive praise; in 1987, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Collins_(television_presenter)" title="Bill Collins (television presenter)">Bill Collins</a> analyzed <i>The Letter</i> (1940), and described her performance as "a brilliant, subtle achievement", and wrote, "Bette Davis makes Leslie Crosbie one of the most extraordinary females in movies." In a 2000 review for <i>All About Eve,</i> (1950) Roger Ebert noted, "Davis was a character, an icon with a grand style, so even her excesses are realistic."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few months before her death in 1989, Davis was one of several actors featured on the cover of <i>Life</i> magazine. In a film retrospective that celebrated the films and stars of 1939, <i>Life</i> concluded that Davis was the most significant actress of her era, and highlighted <i>Dark Victory</i> (1939) as one of the most-important films of the year. Her death made front-page news throughout the world as the "close of yet another chapter of the Golden Age of Hollywood". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Lansbury" title="Angela Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a> summed up the feeling of those of the Hollywood community who attended her memorial service, commenting after a sample from Davis's films were screened, that they had witnessed "an extraordinary legacy of acting in the twentieth century by a real master of the craft", that should provide "encouragement and illustration to future generations of aspiring actors".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, Davis became the first woman to be honored with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI_Life_Achievement_Award" title="AFI Life Achievement Award">AFI Life Achievement Award</a>. In 1999, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> published its list of the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars</a>", which was the result of a film-industry poll to determine the "50 Greatest American Screen Legends" in order to raise public awareness and appreciation of classic film. Of the 25Â actresses listed, Davis was ranked at number two, behind Katharine Hepburn.</p>

The stamp features an image of her in the role of Margo Channing in <i>All About Eve</i> (1950). The First Day of Issue celebration took place September 18, 2008, at Boston University, which houses an extensive Bette Davis archive.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1962 Bette Davis became the first person to secure ten Academy Award nominations for acting.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The focus is on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States" title="Southern United States">Southern</a> aristocrat Regina Hubbard Giddens, who struggles for wealth and freedom within the confines of an early 20th century society where a father considered only sons as legal heirs. As a result, her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avarice" title="Avarice">avaricious</a> brothers Benjamin and Oscar are independently wealthy, while she must rely upon her sickly husband Horace for financial support.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having married his much-maligned, alcoholic wife Birdie solely to acquire her family's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation" title="Plantation">plantation</a> and its cotton fields, Oscar now wants to join forces with Benjamin to construct a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_mill" title="Cotton mill">cotton mill</a>. They approach their sister with their need for an additional $75,000 to invest in the project. Oscar initially proposes a marriage between his son Leo and Regina's daughter Alexandra - first cousins - as a means of getting Horace's money, but Horace and Alexandra are repulsed by the suggestion. When Regina asks Horace outright for the money, he refuses, so Leo is pressured into stealing Horace's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad" title="Railroad">railroad</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)" title="Bond (finance)">bonds</a> from the family business. In order to acquire a larger share in the mill, Regina threatens to report the theft to the police. In retaliation, Horace says he will claim he gave Leo the bonds as a loan, thereby cutting Regina out of the deal completely. When he suffers a heart attack, she makes no effort to give him his medicine, and he dies without anyone knowing his plan, thus enabling Regina to blackmail her brothers. The price she ultimately pays for her innate evil is the loss of Alexandra who, finally understanding the true nature of her mother, elopes with newspaperman David Hewitt. Having let her husband die, alienated her brothers, and driven away her daughter, Regina is left wealthy but completely alone.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallulah_Bankhead" title="Tallulah Bankhead">Tallulah Bankhead</a> had received critical acclaim for her performance in the 1939 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> production of Hellman's play, but director William Wyler, who previously had teamed with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezebel_(film)" title="Jezebel (film)">Jezebel</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Letter_(1940_film)" title="The Letter (1940 film)">The Letter</a></i>, insisted on casting her in the lead role instead. Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Goldwyn" title="Samuel Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> had no reason to argue, since none of Bankhead's films had been box office hits. (Coincidentally, Davis had recreated on film another of Bankhead's Broadway roles, Judith Traherne in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Victory" title="Dark Victory">Dark Victory</a></i>.) Initially, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_L._Warner" title="Jack L. Warner">Jack L. Warner</a> refused to loan his star to Goldwyn, who then offered the role to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a>. When Wyler refused to work with her, Goldwyn resumed negotiations with Warner and finally secured Davis for $385,000. As a contract player at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, Davis was earning $3,000 dollars a week, and when she discovered how much Warner had received for her appearance in <i>Foxes</i>, she demanded and ultimately received a share of the payment.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Wyler encouraged Davis to see Bankhead in the play, which she did despite major misgivings. She later regretted doing so because she felt compelled to create a totally different interpretation of the role, one not necessarily suiting the character. Bankead had portrayed Regina as a victim forced to fight for her survival due to the contempt with which her brothers treated her, but Davis played her as a cold, conniving, calculating woman wearing a death mask of white powder she insisted makeup artist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perc_Westmore" title="Perc Westmore">Perc Westmore</a> create for her. In her autobiography, A Lonely Life, Davis gave a different version about having to see Bankhead in the play. "A great admirer of hers, I wanted in no way to be influenced by her work. It was Willie's intention that I give a different interpretation of the part. I insisted that Tallulah had played it the only way it could be played. Miss Hellman's Regina was written with such definition that it could only be played one way."</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Davis and Wyler frequently fought during filming, about everything from her appearance (Wyler thought she looked like a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabuki" title="Kabuki">Kabuki</a> performer) to the set design (which Davis thought was far too opulent for a family supposedly struggling financially) to her interpretation of the role (Wyler wanted a softer, more sympathetic Regina). Davis had yielded to Wyler's demands during production of <i>The Letter</i>, but this time she held her ground. Not helping the situation was the fact Los Angeles was experiencing its worst heat wave in years, and the temperature on the soundstages regularly rose above 100 degrees. Davis finally walked off the picture. "It was the only time in my career that I walked out on a film after the shooting had begun," she later recalled. "I was a nervous wreck due to the fact that my favorite and most admired director was fighting me every inch of the way . . . I just didn't want to continue."  The actress retreated to her rented house in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laguna_Beach" title="Laguna Beach">Laguna Beach</a> and "<i>flatly</i> refused to come back to work. It took a little courage, to say the least. Goldwyn had it in his power to sue me for the <i>entire</i> cost of the production."  A week later she returned to the set after rumors she would be replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Hepburn" title="Katharine Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> or Miriam Hopkins began to circulate, although Goldwyn was not about to bear the expense of scrapping all the footage with Davis and refilming the scenes with a new actress. Even though the film was a critical and commercial success and nominated for nine <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, she and Wyler never worked together again.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In his review in <i>The New York Times</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> observed, "Lillian Hellman's grim and malignant <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melodrama" title="Melodrama">melodrama</a> . . . has now been translated to the screen with all its original viciousness intact and with such extra-added virulence as the relentless camera of Director William Wyler and the tensile acting of Bette Davis could impart . . . [It] leaps to the front as the most bitingly sinister picture of the year and as one of the most cruelly realistic character studies yet shown on the screen . . . The test of the picture is the effectiveness with which it exposes a family of evil people poisoning everything they touch. And this it does spectacularly. Mr. Wyler, with the aid of Gregg Toland, has used the camera to sweep in the myriad small details of a mauve decadent household and the more indicative facets of the many characters. The focus is sharp, the texture of the images hard and realistic. Individual scenes are extraordinarily vivid and compelling . . . <i>The Little Foxes</i> will not increase your admiration for mankind. It is cold and cynical. But it is a very exciting picture to watch in a comfortably objective way, especially if you enjoy expert stabbing-in-the-back."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> said, "From starring Bette Davis down the line to the bit roles portrayed by minor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negro" title="Negro">Negroes</a> the acting is well nigh flawless . . . Marshall turns in one of his top performances . . . On top of the smooth pace, Wyler has handled every detail with an acutely dramatic touch."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Out_London" title="Time Out London">Time Out London</a></i> said, "Lillian Hellman's play . . . now creaks audibly. But you are unlikely ever to see a better version than this, caressed by Gregg Toland's deep focus camerawork, embalmed by Wyler's direction and Goldwyn's sumptuous production values, galvanised by some superlative performances. The sulphurous Davis, her face a livid mask as she dispenses icy venom behind feline purrs, outdoes herself to provide the proceedings with a regally vicious centre."</p>
