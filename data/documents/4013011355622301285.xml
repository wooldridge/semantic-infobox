	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film begins in 1823 as Salieri, as an old man, attempts <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> by slitting his throat while loudly begging forgiveness for having killed Mozart in 1791. Placed in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunatic_asylum" title="Lunatic asylum">lunatic asylum</a> for the act, Salieri is visited by a young priest who seeks to take his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confession" title="Confession">confession</a>. Salieri is sullen and uninterested but eventually warms to the priest and launches into a long "confession" about the relationship between himself and Mozart. As the scenes later cut back to this dialogue, it appears that Salieri's tale goes on through the night and into the next day. This dialogue comprises a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story" title="Frame story">frame story</a>, with the bulk of the movie being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashbacks</a> to Mozart's lifetime.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salieri reminisces about his youth, particularly about his devotion to God and his love for music and how he pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if he can somehow devote his life to music. He describes how his father's plans for him were to go into business, but Salieri suggests that the sudden death of his father, who choked to death during a meal, was "a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle" title="Miracle">miracle</a>" that allowed Salieri to pursue a career in music. In his narrative, he is suddenly an adult joining the 18th century cultural elite in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, the "city of musicians." Salieri begins his career as a devout, God-fearing man who believes his success and talent as a composer are Godâ€™s rewards for his piety. He is content as the court composer for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Holy Roman Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mozart arrives in Vienna with his patron, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_Hieronymus_von_Colloredo" title="Count Hieronymus von Colloredo">Count Hieronymus von Colloredo</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbishopric_of_Salzburg" title="Archbishopric of Salzburg">Archbishop of Salzburg</a>. Salieri secretly observes Mozart at the Archbishop's palace, but they are not properly introduced. Salieri sees that Mozart off-stage is irreverent and lewd. He also first recognizes the immense talent displayed in the adult works of Mozart. In 1781, when Mozart meets the Emperor, Salieri presents Mozart with a little "March of Welcome," which he had toiled to create. At this meeting, Mozart first displays a childish high-pitched laugh which is heard, at times, throughout the rest of the film. After hearing the march only once, Mozart plays it (pointing out a section where "That doesn't really work, does it?") and effortlessly "improves" it, transforming Salieri's "trifle" into the <i>"Non piÃ¹ andrai"</i> march from his opera <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marriage_of_Figaro" title="The Marriage of Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a></i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salieri reels at the notion of God speaking through the childish, petulant Mozart, whose music he regards as miraculous. Gradually, Salieriâ€™s <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith" title="Faith">faith</a> is shaken. He believes that God, through Mozart's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius" title="Genius">genius</a>, is cruelly laughing at Salieri's own musical mediocrity. Salieri's struggles with God are intercut with scenes showing Mozart's own trials and tribulations with life in Vienna: pride at the initial reception of his music; anger and disbelief over his subsequent treatment by the Italians of the Emperor's court; happiness with his wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constanze_Mozart" title="Constanze Mozart">Constanze</a> and his son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Thomas_Mozart" title="Karl Thomas Mozart">Karl</a>; and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief" title="Grief">grief</a> at the death of his father <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopold_Mozart" title="Leopold Mozart">Leopold</a>. Mozart becomes more desperate as the family's expenses increase and his commissions decrease. When Salieri learns of Mozart's financial straits, he finally sees his chance to avenge himself, using "God's Beloved" (the literal meaning of "Amadeus") as the instrument.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salieri hatches a complex plot to gain ultimate victory over Mozart and over God. He wears a mask and costume similar to one he had seen Leopold wear and commissions the composer to write a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_mass" title="Requiem mass">requiem mass</a>, giving Mozart a down payment and the promise of an enormous sum upon completion. Mozart begins to write perhaps his greatest work, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_(Mozart)" title="Requiem (Mozart)">Requiem Mass in D minor</a>, unaware of the true identity of his mysterious patron and his scheme: to somehow kill him when the work is complete. Glossing over any details of how he might commit the murder, Salieri dwells on the admiration of his peers and the court when they applaud the magnificent Requiem and him when he claims to be the music's composer. Only Salieri and God would know the truth â€“ that Mozart wrote his own requiem mass, and that God could only watch while Salieri finally received the fame and renown he deserved.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Mozart's financial woes continue and the composing demands of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_(Mozart)" title="Requiem (Mozart)">Requiem</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magic_Flute" title="The Magic Flute">The Magic Flute</a></i> drive him to the point of exhaustion as he alternates work between the two pieces. Constanze leaves him and takes their son with her. His health worsens and he collapses during the premiere performance of <i>The Magic Flute</i>. Salieri takes the stricken Mozart home and tricks him into working on the Requiem. Mozart dictates while Salieri transcribes throughout the night. As Constanze returns that morning, she tells Salieri to leave. Constanze locks the manuscript away despite Salieri's objections, but as she goes to wake her husband, Mozart is dead. The Requiem is left unfinished, and Salieri is left powerless as Mozart's body is hauled out of Vienna for burial in a paupers <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_grave" title="Mass grave">mass grave</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film ends as Salieri finishes recounting his story to the visibly shaken young priest. Salieri concludes that <i>God</i> killed Mozart rather than allow Salieri to share in even an ounce of his glory, and that he is consigned to be the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patron_saint" title="Patron saint">patron saint</a> of mediocrity." Salieri <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolution" title="Absolution">absolves</a> the priest of his own mediocrity and blesses his fellow patients as he is taken away in his wheelchair. The last sound heard before the credits roll is Mozart's high-pitched laughter.</p>

According to the film commentary by Forman and Schaffer, Marriner agreed to score the film if Mozart's music was completely unchanged from Mozart's original scores. Marriner did add some notes to Salieri's music that are noticeable in the beginning of the film, as Salieri begins his confession.</p>
