      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood was born in San Francisco to Clinton Eastwood, Sr. (1906â€“70), a steelworker and migrant worker, and Margaret Ruth (nÃ©e Runner; 1909â€“2006), a factory worker. He was a large baby (11 pounds and 6 ounces; 5.62Â kg) and was named "Samson" by the nurses in the hospital. Eastwood is of English, Scottish, Dutch, and Irish ancestry, and was raised in a "middle class Protestant home". His family relocated often, as his father worked at different jobs along the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">West Coast</a>, including at a pulp mill. The family settled in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont,_California" title="Piedmont, California">Piedmont, California</a>, where Eastwood attended <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Middle_School" title="Piedmont Middle School">Piedmont Junior High School</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_High_School_(California)" title="Piedmont High School (California)">Piedmont Senior High School</a>. Later he transferred to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Technical_High_School" title="Oakland Technical High School">Oakland Technical High School</a>, where the drama teachers encouraged him to enroll in school plays, but he was not interested. He held a series of jobs as his family moved to different areas, including paper carrier, grocery clerk, forest firefighter, and golf caddy.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After graduating from high school in 1949, Eastwood intended to enter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_University" title="Seattle University">Seattle University</a> and major in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_theory" title="Music theory">music theory</a>. However, in 1950 he was drafted into the U.S. Army during the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" title="Korean War">Korean War</a>. He was stationed at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Ord" title="Fort Ord">Fort Ord</a>, where his certificate as a lifeguard got him appointed as a life-saving and swimming instructor. He safeguarded film and television actors who had joined the Army through the Special Services program, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Saxon_(actor)" title="John Saxon (actor)">John Saxon</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Janssen" title="David Janssen">David Janssen</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Milner" title="Martin Milner">Martin Milner</a>. In 1951, while on leave, Eastwood rode in a Douglas AD bomber that ran out of fuel and crashed in the ocean near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Reyes" title="Point Reyes">Point Reyes</a>. After escaping from the sinking fuselage, he and the pilot swam 3Â miles (5 km) to the shore.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">He later moved to Los Angeles and began a romance with Maggie Johnson, a college student. During this time he managed an apartment house in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverly_Hills" title="Beverly Hills">Beverly Hills</a> by day (into which he moved) and worked at a Signal Oil gas station by night. He enrolled at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_City_College" title="Los Angeles City College">Los Angeles City College</a> and soon after became engaged to Maggie. They were married shortly before Christmas in 1953 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pasadena,_California" title="South Pasadena, California">South Pasadena</a> and honeymooned in Carmel.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the CBS press release for <i>Rawhide</i>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal</a> (known then as Universal-International) film company happened to be shooting in Fort Ord and an enterprising assistant spotted Eastwood and invited him to meet the director. However, the key figure, according to his official biography, was a man named Chuck Hill, who was stationed in Fort Ord and had contacts in Hollywood. While in Los Angeles, Hill had become reacquainted with Eastwood and managed to sneak Eastwood into a Universal studio, where he showed him to cameraman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Glassberg" title="Irving Glassberg">Irving Glassberg</a>. Glassberg was impressed with Eastwood's appearance and stature and believed him to be "the sort of good looking young man that has traditionally done well in the movies".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Glassberg arranged for director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Lubin" title="Arthur Lubin">Arthur Lubin</a> to meet Eastwood at the gas station where he was working in the evenings in Los Angeles. Lubin, like Glassberg, was highly impressed and promptly arranged for Eastwood's first audition. However, he was somewhat less enthusiastic after seeing the audition, remarking, "He was quite amateurish. He didn't know which way to turn or which way to go or do anything". Lubin nevertheless told Eastwood not to give up, suggesting that he attend drama classes, and later arranging for an initial contract for Eastwood in April 1954 at $100 a week. Some people in Hollywood, including Eastwood's wife Maggie, were suspicious of Lubin's intentions. Lubin was homosexual, and he maintained a close friendship with Eastwood in the years that followed. After signing, Eastwood was initially criticised for his speech and awkward manner; he was soft spoken and, when performing in front of people, was cold, stiff, and awkward. Fellow talent school actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Saxon_(actor)" title="John Saxon (actor)">John Saxon</a> described Eastwood as "being like a kind of hayseed. Thin, rural, with a prominent <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Apple" title="Adam's Apple">Adam's Apple</a>, very laconic and slow speechwise."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In May 1954, Eastwood made his first real audition, trying out for a part in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Six_Bridges_to_Cross&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Six Bridges to Cross (page does not exist)">Six Bridges to Cross</a></i>, a film about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Brink%27s_Robbery" title="Great Brink's Robbery">Brinks robbery</a> that would mark the debut of actor <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sal_Mineo" title="Sal Mineo">Sal Mineo</a>. Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Pevney" title="Joseph Pevney">Joseph Pevney</a> was not impressed by Eastwood's acting and rejected him for any role. Later Eastwood tried out for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigadoon" title="Brigadoon">Brigadoon</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constant_Nymph" title="The Constant Nymph">The Constant Nymph</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_Brigade" title="Bengal Brigade">Bengal Brigade</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Year_Itch" title="The Seven Year Itch">The Seven Year Itch</a></i> in May 1954, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sign_of_the_Pagan&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Sign of the Pagan (page does not exist)">Sign of the Pagan</a></i> (June), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smoke_Signal&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Smoke Signal (page does not exist)">Smoke Signal</a></i> (August) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_and_Costello_Meet_the_Keystone_Kops" title="Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops">Abbott and Costello Meet the Keystone Kops</a></i> (September), all without success. He was eventually given a minor role by director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Arnold_(director)" title="Jack Arnold (director)">Jack Arnold</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenge_of_the_Creature" title="Revenge of the Creature">Revenge of the Creature</a></i>, a film set in the Amazon jungle, which was the sequel to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creature_from_the_Black_Lagoon" title="The Creature from the Black Lagoon">The Creature from the Black Lagoon</a></i>, released just months earlier.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In September 1954, Eastwood worked for three weeks on Arthur Lubin's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva_of_Coventry" title="Lady Godiva of Coventry">Lady Godiva of Coventry</a></i> in which he donned a medieval costume, and screen tested for the role with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Olive_Sturgess&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Olive Sturgess (page does not exist)">Olive Sturgess</a>, and then in February 1955, won a role playing "Jonesy", a sailor in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_in_the_Navy" title="Francis in the Navy">Francis in the Navy</a></i> and his salary was raised to $300 a week for the four weeks of shooting. He again appeared in a Jack Arnold film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarantula_(film)" title="Tarantula (film)">Tarantula</a></i>, with a small role as a squadron pilot, again uncredited. In May 1955, Eastwood put four hours work into the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Say_Goodbye_(1956_film)" title="Never Say Goodbye (1956 film)">Never Say Goodbye</a></i>, in which he again plays a white coated technician uttering a single line and again had a minor uncredited role as a ranch hand (his first western film) in August 1955 with <i>Law Man</i>, also known as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stars_in_the_Dust&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Stars in the Dust (page does not exist)">Stars in the Dust</a></i>. He gained experience behind the set, watching productions and dubbing and editing sessions of other films at Universal Studios, notably the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Clift" title="Montgomery Clift">Montgomery Clift</a> film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Place_in_the_Sun" title="A Place in the Sun">A Place in the Sun</a></i>. Universal presented him with his first TV role with a small television debut on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <i>Allen in Movieland</i> on July 2, 1955, starring actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Curtis" title="Tony Curtis">Tony Curtis</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Goodman" title="Benny Goodman">Benny Goodman</a>. Although his records at Universal revealed his development, Universal terminated his contract on October 23, 1955, leaving Eastwood gutted and blaming casting director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Robert_Palmer_(casting_director)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Robert Palmer (casting director) (page does not exist)">Robert Palmer</a>, on whom he would exact revenge years later, when Palmer came looking for employment at his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpaso_Company" title="Malpaso Company">Malpaso Company</a>. Eastwood rejected him.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On the recommendation of Betty Jane Howarth, Eastwood soon joined new publicity representatives, the Marsh Agency, who had represented actors such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_West" title="Adam West">Adam West</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Long_(actor)" title="Richard Long (actor)">Richard Long</a>. Although Eastwood's contract with Lubin had ended, he was important in landing Eastwood his biggest role to date; a featured role in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginger_Rogers" title="Ginger Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a>â€“<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Channing" title="Carol Channing">Carol Channing</a> western comedy, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_First_Traveling_Saleslady" title="The First Traveling Saleslady">The First Traveling Saleslady</a></i>. Eastwood played a recruitment officer for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teddy_Roosevelt" title="Teddy Roosevelt">Teddy Roosevelt</a>'s Rough Riders. He would also play a pilot in another of Lubin's productions, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapade_in_Japan" title="Escapade in Japan">Escapade in Japan</a></i> and would make several TV appearances under Lubin even into the early 1960s. As Eastwood grew in success, he never spoke to Lubin again until 1992, shortly after winning his Oscar for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgiven" title="Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></i>, when Eastwood promised a lunch that never happened.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Without the Lubin contract in the meantime, however, Eastwood was struggling. He was financially advised by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Irving_Leonard&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Irving Leonard (page does not exist)">Irving Leonard</a> and, under Leonard's influence, changed talent agencies in rapid succession: the Kumin-Olenick Agency in 1956 and Mitchell Gertz in 1957. He landed a small role as a temperamental army officer for a segment of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>'s <i>Reader's Digest</i> series, broadcast in January 1956, and later that year, a motorcycle gang member on a <i>Highway Patrol</i> episode. In 1957, Eastwood played a cadet who becomes involved in a skiing search and rescue in the 'White Fury' installment of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Point" title="West Point">West Point</a></i> series. He also appeared in an episode of the prime time series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_Train" title="Wagon Train">Wagon Train</a></i> and played a suicidal gold prospector in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Valley_Days" title="Death Valley Days">Death Valley Days</a></i>. In 1958, he played a Navy lieutenant in a segment of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Log" title="Navy Log">Navy Log</a></i> and in early 1959 made a notable guest appearance as a cowardly villain, intent on marrying a rich girl for money, in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(TV_series)" title="Maverick (TV series)">Maverick</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood was credited for his roles in several more films.

He did, however, have a small part as an aviator in the French picture <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lafayette_Escadrille_(film)" title="Lafayette Escadrille (film)">Lafayette Escadrille</a></i>, and played an ex-renegade in the Confederacy in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_at_Cimarron_Pass" title="Ambush at Cimarron Pass">Ambush at Cimarron Pass</a></i>, his biggest screen role to date opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Brady" title="Scott Brady">Scott Brady</a>. His part was shot in nine days for Regal Films Inc. Out of frustration, he said after watching it at the premiere, "It was sooo bad. I just kept sinking lower and lower in my seat and just wanted to quit". Around the time the film was released, Eastwood described himself as feeling "really depressed" and regards it as the lowest point in his career and a point when he seriously considered quitting the acting profession.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1958, Eastwood learned from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bill_Shiffrin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Bill Shiffrin (page does not exist)">Bill Shiffrin</a> that CBS was casting an hour-long Western series and arranged for a screen test. With screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Marquis_Warren" title="Charles Marquis Warren">Charles Marquis Warren</a> overlooking, Eastwood had to recite one of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>'s monologues from the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wellman" title="William Wellman">William Wellman</a> western, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ox-Bow_Incident" title="The Ox-Bow Incident">The Ox-Bow Incident</a></i> in his audition. A week later, Shiffrin rang Eastwood and informed him he had won the part of Rowdy Yates in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide_(TV_series)" title="Rawhide (TV series)">Rawhide</a></i>. He had successfully beaten competition such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bing_Russell" title="Bing Russell">Bing Russell</a> and had got the break he had been looking for.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> in the summer of 1958. Although Eastwood was finally pleased with the direction of his career, he was not especially happy with the nature of his Rowdy Yates character. At this time, Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part, privately describing Yates as "the idiot of the plains".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It took just three weeks for <i>Rawhide</i> to reach the top 20 in the TV ratings and soon rescheduled the timeslot half an hour earlier from 7.30 -8.30 pm every Friday, guaranteeing more of a family audience. For several years it was a major success, and reached its peak as number 6 in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. However, success was not without its price. The <i>Rawhide</i> years (1959â€“65) were undoubtedly the most grueling of his life, and at first, from July until April, they filmed six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day. Although it never won <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy" title="Emmy">Emmy</a> stature, <i>Rawhide</i> earned critical acclaim and won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Heritage_(magazine)" title="American Heritage (magazine)">American Heritage Award</a> as the best Western series on TV and it was nominated several times for best episode by the Writer's and Director's Guilds. Despite appearing in all 217 episodes, Eastwood received some criticism during this period and was considered too laid back and lazy by some directors who believed he relied on his looks and just did not work hard enough.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood appeared in a western comedy series <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maverick_(TV_series)" title="Maverick (TV series)">Maverick</a></i>, in which he fought <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner" title="James Garner">James Garner</a> in the "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duel_at_Sundown_(Maverick)" title="Duel at Sundown (Maverick)">Duel at Sundown</a>" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Maverick_episodes" title="List of Maverick episodes">episode</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In late 1963, an offer was made to Eastwood's co-star Eric Fleming on <i>Rawhide</i> to star in an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italian</a>-made western (<i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fistful_of_Dollars" title="A Fistful of Dollars">A Fistful of Dollars</a></i>), originally named <i>The Magnificent Stranger</i>, to be directed in a remote region of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> by a relative unknown at the time, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Leone" title="Sergio Leone">Sergio Leone</a>.

Harrison suggested Clint Eastwood, whom he knew could play a cowboy convincingly.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Through Irving Leonard, the offer was made to Eastwood, who saw it as an opportunity to escape <i>Rawhide</i> and the States, and as a paid vacation. He signed the contract for $15,000 in wages for eleven weeks work, which also threw in a bonus of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz" title="Mercedes-Benz">Mercedes</a> automobile upon completion. He arrived in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> in May 1964. Eastwood was instrumental in creating the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_With_No_Name" title="Man With No Name">Man With No Name</a> character's distinctive visual style that would appear throughout the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollars_trilogy" title="Dollars trilogy"><i>Dollars</i> trilogy</a>. He brought with him black jeans he had purchased from a shop on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Boulevard" title="Hollywood Boulevard">Hollywood Boulevard</a> which he bleached out and roughened up. The hat from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Monica" title="Santa Monica">Santa Monica</a> wardrobe firm, a leather bracelet, two Indian leather cases with dual serpents and the trademark black <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cigars" title="Cigars">cigars</a> came from a Beverly Hills shop. According to McGilligan, Eastwood himself is a non-smoker and hated the smell of cigar smoke, though he is also seen smoking in other films, including "Coogan's Bluff" and "Gran Torino". Leone decided to use them to heavily emphasize the "look" of the mysterious stranger in the film. Leone commented, "The truth is that I needed a mask more than an actor, and Eastwood at the time only had two facial expressions: one with the hat, and one without it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first interiors for the film were shot at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinecitt%C3%A0" title="CinecittÃ ">CinecittÃ </a> studio on the outskirts of Rome, before quickly moving to a small village in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia" title="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> in an area which was also used for filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_(film)" title="Lawrence of Arabia (film)">Lawrence of Arabia</a></i> (1962) just a few years earlier. <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i> would become a benchmark in the development of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_western" title="Spaghetti western">spaghetti westerns</a>, and Leone would successfully create a new icon of a western hero, depicting a more lawless and desolate world than in traditional westerns. The film made Eastwood into a major film star in Italy. The trilogy redefined the stereotypical American image of a western hero and cowboy, creating a character <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunslinger" title="Gunslinger">gunslinger</a> and bounty hunter which was more of an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero" title="Antihero">antihero</a> than a hero and with a distinct moral ambiguity, unlike traditional heroes of western cinema in the United States such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Leone hired Eastwood to star in his second film of what would become a trilogy, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_a_Few_Dollars_More" title="For a Few Dollars More">For a Few Dollars More</a></i> (1965). Screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciano_Vincenzoni" title="Luciano Vincenzoni">Luciano Vincenzoni</a> was brought in to write the script which he wrote in nine days; two bounty hunters (Eastwood and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Van_Cleef" title="Lee Van Cleef">Lee Van Cleef</a>) pursuing a drug-addicted criminal (VolontÃ¨), planning to rob an impregnable bank. <i>For a Few Dollars More</i> was shot in the spring and summer of 1965 and again interiors of the film were shot at the CinecittÃ  studio in Rome before they moved to Spain again. Screenwriter Vincenzoni was very important in bringing the films to the states, given that he was fluent in English and accompanied Leone to a cinema in Rome to show the new film after completion to United Artist executives <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Krim" title="Arthur Krim">Arthur Krim</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Picker" title="Arnold Picker">Arnold Picker</a>. He sold the rights to the film and the third film (which was yet to be written let alone made) in advance in the states for $900,000, advancing $500,000 up front and the right to half of the profits.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 1966, Eastwood met with producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dino_De_Laurentiis" title="Dino De Laurentiis">Dino De Laurentiis</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> and agreed to star in a non-Western five-part anthology production named <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_streghe" title="Le streghe">Le streghe</a></i> or <i>The Witches</i> opposite De Laurentiis' wife, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvana_Mangano" title="Silvana Mangano">Silvana Mangano</a>. Eastwood's nineteen minute installment only took a few days to shoot and was not met well with critics, who described it as "no other performance of his is quite so 'un-Clintlike' ", with the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> disparaging it as a "throwaway De Sica".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Two months after his De Sica shoot, Eastwood began working on the third Dollars film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly" title="The Good, the Bad and the Ugly">The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</a></i>, in which he again played the mysterious Man With No Name character. Lee Van Cleef was brought in again to play a ruthless fortune seeker, while <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Wallach" title="Eli Wallach">Eli Wallach</a>, a character actor noted for his appearance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magnificent_Seven" title="The Magnificent Seven">The Magnificent Seven</a></i> (1960), was hired to play the cunning Mexican bandit "Tuco", although the role was originally written for VolontÃ¨, who passed on working with Leone again. The three become involved in a search for a buried cache of confederate gold buried in a cemetery by a man named Jackson, in hiding as Bill Carson. Eastwood was not initially pleased with the script and was concerned he might be upstaged by Wallach, and said to Leone, "In the first film I was alone. In the second, we were two. Here we are three. If it goes on this way, in the next one I will be starring with the American cavalry".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began at the CinecittÃ  studio in Rome again in mid-May 1966, including the opening scene between Clint and Wallach when The Man With No Name captures Tuco for the first time and sends him to jail. The production then moved on to Spain's plateau region near <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burgos" title="Burgos">Burgos</a> in the north, which would double for the extreme deep south of the United States, and again shot the western scenes in Almeria in the south. This time the production required more elaborate sets, including a town under cannon fire, an extensive prison camp and an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> battlefield; and for the climax, several hundred Spanish soldiers were employed to build a cemetery with several thousand grave stones to resemble an ancient <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_(building)" title="Circus (building)">Roman circus</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Dollars trilogy was not shown in the United States until 1967. <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i> opened in January, <i>For a Few Dollars More</i> in May and <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i> in December 1967. The trilogy was publicised as James Bond -type entertainment and all films were successful in American cinemas and turned Eastwood into a major film star in 1967, particularly <i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i> which eventually collected $8 million in rental earnings. However, upon release, all three were generally given bad reviews by critics (despite the select few American critics who had seen the films in Italy previously having a positive outlook) and marked the beginning of Eastwood's battle to win the respect of American film critics. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Crist" title="Judith Crist">Judith Crist</a> described <i>A Fistful of Dollars</i> as "cheapjack" and believed that "it had nothing on its mind but <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sadism" title="wikt:sadism">sadism</a>". <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> described <i>For a Few Dollars More</i> as "excruciatingly dopey" and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renata_Adler" title="Renata Adler">Renata Adler</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> remarked that it was "the most expensive, pious and repellent movie in the history of its peculiar genre". However while <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> highlighted the wooden acting, especially Eastwood's, critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Canby" title="Vincent Canby">Vincent Canby</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of the <i>New York Times</i> were praising of Eastwood's coolness playing the tall, lone stranger; and Leone's unique style of cinematography was widely acclaimed, even by some critics who disliked the acting.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood spent much of late 1966 and 1967 dubbing for the English-language version of the films and being interviewed, something which left him feeling angry and frustrated. Stardom brought more roles in the "tough guy" mold and Irving Leornard (who would later pass away at Christmas 1969) gave him a script to a new film, the American revisionist western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hang_%27Em_High" title="Hang 'Em High">Hang 'Em High</a></i>, a cross between <i>Rawhide</i> and Leone's westerns, written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mel_Goldberg&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Mel Goldberg (page does not exist)">Mel Goldberg</a> and produced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Freeman" title="Leonard Freeman">Leonard Freeman</a>. Eastwood signed for the film with a salary of $400,000 and 25% of the net earnings to the film, playing the character of Cooper, a man accused by vigilantes of a cow baron's murder and lynched and left for dead and later seeks revenge. With the wealth generated by the Dollars trilogy, Leonard helped set up a new production company for Eastwood, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malpaso_Productions" title="Malpaso Productions">Malpaso Productions</a>, something he had long yearned for and was named after a river on Eastwood's property in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_County" title="Monterey County">Monterey County</a>. Leonard became the company's president and arranged for <i>Hang 'Em High</i> to be a joint production with United Artists. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inger_Stevens" title="Inger Stevens">Inger Stevens</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farmer%27s_Daughter_(TV_series)" title="The Farmer's Daughter (TV series)">The Farmer's Daughter</a></i> fame was cast to play the role of Rachel Warren with a supporting cast which included <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Hingle" title="Pat Hingle">Pat Hingle</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Hopper" title="Dennis Hopper">Dennis Hopper</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Begley" title="Ed Begley">Ed Begley</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Dern" title="Bruce Dern">Bruce Dern</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_MacArthur" title="James MacArthur">James MacArthur</a>.

The film became a major success after release in July 1968 and with an opening day revenue of $5,241 in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore" title="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> alone, it became the biggest United Artists opening in history, exceeding all of the James Bond films at that time. It debuted at number five on Variety's weekly survey of top films and had made its money back within two weeks of screening. It was widely praised by critics including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arthur_Winsten&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Arthur Winsten (page does not exist)">Arthur Winsten</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post" title="New York Post">New York Post</a></i> who described <i>Hang 'Em High</i> as "A Western of quality, courage, danger and excitement".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Meanwhile, before <i>Hang 'Em High</i> had been released, Eastwood had set to work on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coogan%27s_Bluff_(film)" title="Coogan's Bluff (film)">Coogan's Bluff</a></i>, a project which saw him reunite with Universal Studios after an offer of $1 million, more than doubling his previous salary. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennings_Lang" title="Jennings Lang">Jennings Lang</a> was responsible for the deal, a former agent of a director named <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Siegel" title="Don Siegel">Don Siegel</a>, a Universal contract director who was invited to direct Eastwood's second major American film. Eastwood was not familiar with Siegel's work but Lang arranged for them to meet at Clint's residence in Carmel. Eastwood had now seen three of Siegel's earlier films and was impressed with his directing and the two became natural friends, forming a close partnership in the years that followed. The idea for <i>Coogan's Bluff</i> originated in early 1967 as a TV series and the first draft was drawn up by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Miller_(writer)" title="Herman Miller (writer)">Herman Miller</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Laird" title="Jack Laird">Jack Laird</a>, screenwriters for <i>Rawhide</i>.

After Siegel and Eastwood had agreed to work together, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Howard_Rodman&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Howard Rodman (page does not exist)">Howard Rodman</a> and three other writers were hired to devise a new script as the new team scouted for locations including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. However, Eastwood surprised the team one day by calling an impromptu meeting and professing that he strongly disliked the script, which by now had gone through seven drafts, preferring Herman Miller's original concept. This experience would also shape Eastwood's distaste for redrafting scripts in his later career. Eastwood and Siegel decided to hire a new writer, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Riesner" title="Dean Riesner">Dean Riesner</a>, who had written for Siegel in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a> TV film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stranger_on_the_Run&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Stranger on the Run (page does not exist)">Stranger on the Run</a></i> some years previously. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Stroud" title="Don Stroud">Don Stroud</a> was cast as the psychopathic criminal Coogan is chasing, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Cobb" title="Lee J.

Filming began in November 1967 even before the full script had been finalized. The film was controversial for its portrayal of violence, but it had launched a collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel that lasted more than ten years, and set the prototype for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machismo" title="Machismo">macho</a> hero that Eastwood would play in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry" title="Dirty Harry">Dirty Harry</a></i> films.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood was paid $850,000 in 1968 for the war epic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Eagles_Dare" title="Where Eagles Dare">Where Eagles Dare</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>.

The film saw Eastwood embody the tall mysterious stranger once more, unshaven, wearing a serape-like vest and smoking a cigar and the film score was composed by Morricone. However, although the film also had Leonesque dirty Hispanic villains, the film was considerably less crude and more sardonic than those of Leone. The film, which took four months to shoot and cost around $4 million to make, received moderate reviews, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Greenspun" title="Roger Greenspun">Roger Greenspun</a> of the <i>New York Times</i> reported, "I'm not sure it is a great movie, but it is very good and it stays and grows on the mind the way only movies of exceptional narrative intelligence do". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann" title="Stanley Kauffmann">Stanley Kauffmann</a> described the film as "an attempt to keep old Hollywood alive- a place where nuns <i>can</i> turn out to be disguised whores, where heroes <i>can</i> always have a stick of dynamite under their vests, where every story has not one but two cute finishes.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the winter of 1969â€“70, Eastwood and Siegel began planning his next film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beguiled" title="The Beguiled">The Beguiled</a></i>. Jennings Lang was inspired by the 1966 novel by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Cullinan_(author)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Thomas Cullinan (author) (page does not exist)">Thomas Cullinan</a> and in passing the book to Eastwood he was engrossed throughout the night in reading the tale of a wounded Union soldier held captive by the sexually repressed matron of a southern girls' school. This was the first of several films where Eastwood has agreed to storylines where he is the centre of female attention, including minors. The film, according to Siegel, deals with the themes of sex, violence and vengeance and was based on "the basic desire of women to castrate men". The film later received major recognition in France and is considered one of Eastwood's finest works by the French. However, although the film reached number two on <i>Variety'</i>s chart of top grossing films, it was poorly marketed and in the end grossed less than $1 million. According to Eastwood and Jennings Lang, the film, aside from being poorly publicized, flopped due to Clint being "emasculated in the film".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1971 proved to be a professional turning point in Eastwood's career. Before Irving Leonard had died, the last film they had discussed at Malpaso was to give Eastwood the artistic control that he desired and make his directorial debut in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_Misty_for_Me" title="Play Misty for Me">Play Misty for Me</a></i>.

Dirty Harry is arguably Eastwood's most memorable character and the lines that Callahan utters when addressing a wounded bank robber are often cited amongst the most memorable in cinematic history (see box). The film has been credited with inventing the "loose-cannon cop genre" that is imitated to this day. Eastwood's tough, no-nonsense portrayal of Dirty Harry touched a cultural nerve with many who were fed up with crime in the streets and at a time when there were prevalent reports of local and federal police committing atrocities and overstepping their authority by entrapment and obstruction of justice. <i>Dirty Harry</i> marked the beginning of Eastwood's work with legendary <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_poster" title="Film poster">film poster</a> designer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gold" title="Bill Gold">Bill Gold</a>.

After release in December 1971, Dirty Harry proved a phenomenal success which would be go on to become Siegel's highest grossing film and the start of a series of films which is arguably Eastwood's signature role, with fans demanding more. Although a number of critics such as Jay Cocks of <i>Time</i> praised his performance as Dirty Harry, describing him as "giving his best performance so far, tense, tough, full of implicit identification with his character", the film was widely criticized and accused of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a> through Eastwood's portrayal of the ruthless cop. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" title="Feminism">Feminists</a> in particular were outraged by the film and at the Oscars for 1971 protested outside holding up banners which read messages such as "Dirty Harry is a Rotten Pig".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Around this time, Eastwood was offered the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond" title="James Bond">James Bond</a> following the departure of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Connery" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a>, but turned it down due to his belief that the character should be played by an English actor. Eastwood next starred in the loner Western <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Kidd" title="Joe Kidd">Joe Kidd</a></i>, released in 1972. Originally called <i>The Sinola Courthouse Raid</i>, it was about a character inspired by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reies_Lopez_Tijerina" title="Reies Lopez Tijerina">Reies Lopez Tijerina</a>, an ardent supporter of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy" title="Robert F.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood was also far from in perfect health during the film and suffered symptoms that relayed the possibility of a bronchial infection and suffered several panic attacks, falsely reported in the media as him having an allergy to horses. <i>Joe Kidd</i> received a mixed reception. For instance <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Greenspun" title="Roger Greenspun">Roger Greenspun</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i> thought the film overall was nothing remarkable and had foolish symbolism and what he suspected was sloppy editing, but praised Eastwood's performance (see box).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">1973 proved another benchmark to Eastwood when he directed his first western, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Plains_Drifter" title="High Plains Drifter">High Plains Drifter</a></i>. It involves the story of a tall, mysterious stranger arriving in a brooding Western town where the people share a guilty secret. They hire the stranger to defend the town against three felons soon to be released but fail to recognise that they once killed this stranger in a brutal whipping and that his reappearance is supernatural. The ghostly stranger forces the people to paint the town red and names it "Hell" and seeks revenge. Holes in the plot were filled in with black humor and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory" title="Allegory">allegory</a>, influenced by Sergio Leone. There was some confusion amongst critics and viewers of the film as to whether the avenging character was actually the ghost of the murdered sheriff or a sibling; according to Eastwood he played him as a brother. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> was offered a role in the film and was sent the script, but replied to Eastwood some weeks after the film was released, expressing disapproval, saying that "the townspeople did not represent the true spirit of the American pioneer, the spirit that made America great. The revisionist film received a mixed reception from critics but was a major box office success. A number of critics thought Eastwood's directing was as a derivative as it was expressive with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Knight_(film_critic)" title="Arthur Knight (film critic)">Arthur Knight</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Review_(US_magazine)" title="Saturday Review (US magazine)">Saturday Review</a></i> remarking that Clint had "absorbed the approaches of Siegel and Leone and fused them with his own paranoid vision of society". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Landau" title="Jon Landau">Jon Landau</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> concurred, remarking that it is his thematic shallowness and verbal archness which is where the film fell apart, yet he expressed approval of the dramatic scenery and cinematography.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood turned his attention towards a script written by Jo Heims about a love blossoming between a middle-aged man and a teenage girl, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breezy" title="Breezy">Breezy</a></i>. During casting for the film, Eastwood met <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondra_Locke" title="Sondra Locke">Sondra Locke</a> for the first time, an actress who would play a major role in many of his films for the next ten years and an important figure in his life.

Filming for <i>Breezy</i> began in the November of 1972 in Los Angeles. With Surtees occupied elsewhere, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Stanley_(cinematographer)" title="Frank Stanley (cinematographer)">Frank Stanley</a> was brought in to shoot the picture, the first of four films he would shoot for Malpaso. The film was shot very quickly and efficiently and in the end went $1 million under budget and finished three days before schedule. The film was not a major critical or commercial success, it barely reached the Top 50 before disappearing and was only made available on video in 1998.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After the filming of <i>Breezy</i> had finished, Warner Brothers announced that Eastwood had agreed to reprise his role as Detective Harry Callahan in a sequel to Dirty Harry, running under the title, <i>Vigilance</i> but later changed to <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnum_Force" title="Magnum Force">Magnum Force</a></i> given its gun theme.

During filming Eastwood encountered numerous disputes with director Ted Post, scarring their relationship for several years. Although the film was a major success after release, grossing $58.1 million in the United States alone, a new record for Eastwood, it was not a critical success. <i>New York Times</i> critics such as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nora_Sayre&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Nora Sayre (page does not exist)">Nora Sayre</a> criticized the often contradictory moral themes of the film and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</a> believed it "was the same old stuff".</p>

On release in spring 1974, the film was praised for its offbeat comedy mixed with high suspense and tragedy and Eastwood's acting performance was noted by critics but was overshadowed by Jeff Bridges who stole the show in his performance as Lightfoot. When Bridges was nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Supporting_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor">Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>, Eastwood was reportedly fuming at his own lack of Academy Award recognition. Despite critical acclaim, however, the film was only a modest success at the box office, earning $32.4 million. Eastwood was unhappy with the way that United Artists had produced the film and swore "he would never work for United Artists again", and the scheduled two film deal between Malpaso and UA was cancelled.</p>

A 27-year old English climber David Knowles, who was acting as body double and photographer was tragically killed during filming, with Hoover narrowly escaping. Eastwood continued to insist on doing all his own climbing and stunts, despite potentially being just seconds from instant death.

This marked the beginning of a close relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would last six films and the beginning of a raging romance that would last into the late 1980s. The film also featured his real-life seven-year old son <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Eastwood" title="Kyle Eastwood">Kyle Eastwood</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Principal photography for <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> began in mid-October 1975. A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming and soon after filming moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanab" title="Kanab">Kanab</a>, Utah on October 24, 1975, Kaufman was notoriously fired under Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley. The sacking caused an outrage amongst the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directors_Guild_of_America" title="Directors Guild of America">Directors Guild of America</a> and other important Hollywood executives and resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation. It resulted in the Director's Guild passing new legislation which reserved the right to impose a major fine on a producer for discharging a director and replacing him with himself. From then on the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second in command, but with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team were able to finish making the film efficiently.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon release in August 1976, <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i> was widely acclaimed by critics. Many critics and viewers saw Eastwood's role as an iconic one, relating it with much of America's ancestral past and the destiny of the nation after the American Civil War. The film was pre-screened at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Valley,_Idaho" title="Sun Valley, Idaho">Sun Valley</a> Center for the Arts and Humanities in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho" title="Idaho">Idaho</a> in a six-day conference entitled, <i>Western Movies:Myths and Images</i> and attended by some two hundred esteemed film critics, academics and directors. The film would later appear in <i>Time</i> magazines Top 10 films of the year. Roger Ebert compared the nature and vulnerability of Eastwood's portrayal of Josey Wales with his Man With No Name character in his <i>Dollars</i> westerns and praised the atmosphere of the film. The film is seen by many as a Western masterpiece and has been awarded a 97% rating on the critical website Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After <i>The Outlaw Josey Wales</i>, Eastwood was offered the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_L._Willard" title="Benjamin L.

Eastwood refused the part and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burt_Lancaster" title="Burt Lancaster">Burt Lancaster</a> played the character instead. In the end it was decided to make a third <i>Dirty Harry</i> film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enforcer" title="The Enforcer">The Enforcer</a></i>. The script, devised by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_Silliphant" title="Stirling Silliphant">Stirling Silliphant</a> had Harry up against a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> area <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army" title="Symbionese Liberation Army">Symbionese Liberation Army</a> type group, which in real life had terrorized the area in 1974 with ruthless kidnappings and violence, and the film would end in a shoot out at the gang's hideout on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz" title="Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a> island. Eastwood met Silliphant in a restaurant in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburon,_California" title="Tiburon, California">Tiburon</a> and instantly took a liking to the script, particularly the shoot out and the idea of Callahan having a woman as a police partner, his worst nightmare, a relationship which would gradually blossom during the course of the film and provide a backbone to the film's structure as they encounter different situations, from initial hatred to a fondness of each other and Callahan's genuine sorrow on her being shot in the finale. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyne_Daly" title="Tyne Daly">Tyne Daly</a>, who got the part of the female cop, was given considerable leeway in the development of her character, although after seeing the film at the premiere was horrified by the extent of the violence.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With James Fargo to direct, filming commenced in the San Francisco Bay area in the summer of 1976. The film ended up considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films, and was cut to 95 minutes. Upon release in the fall of 1976, <i>The Enforcer</i> was a major commercial success and grossed a total of $100 million, $60 million in the United States and easily became Eastwood's best selling film to date, earning more than some of his previous films combined. However, critically, Eastwood's performance was poorly received and was named "Worst Actor of the Year" by the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Lampoon" title="Harvard Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a></i> and the film was criticized for its level of violence. His performance in the third installment was overshadowed by positive reviews given to Daly in her convincing role as the strong-minded female cop.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1977, Eastwood directed and starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gauntlet_(film)" title="The Gauntlet (film)">The Gauntlet</a></i>, in which he played a down-and-out cop who falls in love with a prostitute whom he's assigned to escort from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a> to Phoenix in order for her to testify against the mob.

Although a moderate hit with the viewing public, critics were mixed about the film, with many believing it was overly violent. Eastwood's long time nemesis Pauline Kael called it "a tale varnished with foul language and garnished with violence". Roger Ebert, on the other hand, gave it three stars and called it "...classic Clint Eastwood: fast, furious, and funny." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ansen" title="David Ansen">David Ansen</a> of <i>Newsweek</i> wrote, "You don't believe a minute of it, but at the end of the quest, it's hard not to chuckle and cheer". In 1978, Eastwood starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Which_Way_but_Loose_(film)" title="Every Which Way but Loose (film)">Every Which Way but Loose</a></i> an uncharacteristic, offbeat comedy role.

Upon its release, the film was a surprising success and became Eastwood's most commercially successful film at the time and ranks high amongst those of his career to date, becoming the second-highest grossing film of the year. However, it was panned by the critics, with <i>Variety</i> commenting that, "This film is so awful it's almost as if Eastwood is using it to find out how far he can goâ€”how bad a film he can associate himself with". David Ansen of <i>Newsweek</i> described the film as, "plotless junk heap of moronic gags, sour romance and fatuous fisticuffs.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1979, Eastwood starred in the fact-based movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_from_Alcatraz_(film)" title="Escape from Alcatraz (film)">Escape from Alcatraz</a></i>, based on the true story of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Morris_(prisoner)" title="Frank Morris (prisoner)">Frank Lee Morris</a>, who, along with John and Clarence Anglin escaped from the notorious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz" title="Alcatraz">Alcatraz</a> prison in 1962.

However, Siegel inisted that it be a Don Siegel film and out-maneouvered Clint by purchasing the rights to the film for $100,000. This created a rift between the friends, causing Siegel to depart to Paramount, a rival studio. Although their disagreement was later patched up and Siegel agreed for it to be a Malpaso-Siegel production, Siegel would never direct an Eastwood picture again. As Siegel and Tuggle worked on the script, the producers paid $500,000 to restore the decaying prison and recreate the cold atmosphere, although some interiors had to be recreated within the studio. The film was a major success, earning $34 million in the states alone and was widely acclaimed by critics, marking the beginning of a newly found critical praise Eastwood began to receive in the early 1980s. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Rich" title="Frank Rich">Frank Rich</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine)" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> described the film as "cool, cinematic grace", whilst <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Kauffmann" title="Stanley Kauffmann">Stanley Kauffmann</a> of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Republic" title="The New Republic">The New Republic</a></i> called it "crystalline cinema".</p>

The film received a number of bad reviews from critics, although Janet Maslin of the <i>New York Times</i> described it as, "funnier and even better than its predescessor".

Nevertheless, <i>Pale Rider</i> became one of Eastwood's most successful films to date in the eyes of critics, earning him the wide critical acclaim he had sought for so long. Jeffrey Lyons of <i>Sneak Previews</i> said, "Easily one of the best films of the year, and one of the best westerns in a long, long time". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Siskel" title="Gene Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i> said, "This year (1985) will go down in film history as the moment Clint Eastwood finally earned respect as an artist".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1986, Eastwood starred in the military drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbreak_Ridge" title="Heartbreak Ridge">Heartbreak Ridge</a></i>, about the 1983 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">U.S.</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Grenada" title="Invasion of Grenada">invasion of Grenada</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" title="West Indies">West Indies</a>, with a portion of the movie filmed on the island itself.

Eastwood incorporated more scenes of action and comedy into the film than was initially intended by the original drafter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=James_Carabatsos&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="James Carabatsos (page does not exist)">James Carabatsos</a>, and worked hard with Megan Rose to revise it. Eastwood and producer Fritz Manes meanwhile, intent on making the film realistic, visited the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon" title="Pentagon">Pentagon</a> and various air bases to request assistance and approval. The U.S. army refused to help, due to Highway being portrayed as a hard drinker, divorced from his wife, and using unapproved motivational methods to his troops, an image the army did not want. They informed the production team that the characterisation lacked credibility and that Eastwood's character was an outdated stereotype and that he was too old for the role. They instead approached the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>, and Lieutenant Colonel Fred Peck was hired as a spokesman for the military during filming and to guide Eastwood's team to making the characters and scenes more realistic. The production and filming of <i>Heartbreak Ridge</i> was marred by internal disagreements, between Eastwood and long term friend Fritz Manes who was producing it and between Eastwood and the DOD who expressed contempt at the film. During the film, Peck came to head with Eastwood over a scene involving Eastwood offering a drink in a flask to the Sergeant Major; Peck stood his ground and insisted this scene was laughable. Eastwood eventually relented but the relationship between the producers continued to sour. Within months, Manes was fired and Eastwood had rid of his best friend and producing partner, replacing him with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Valdes" title="David Valdes">David Valdes</a>. The film released in 1470 theatres, grossing a very respectable $70 million domestically.</p>

Eastwood began working on smaller, more personal projects, marking a serious lull in his career between 1988 and 1992. He directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_(film)" title="Bird (film)">Bird</a></i> (1988), a biopic starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Whitaker" title="Forest Whitaker">Forest Whitaker</a> as jazz musician <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Parker" title="Charlie Parker">Charlie "Bird" Parker</a>, a genre of music that Eastwood has always been personally interested in.

Critic Pauline Kael published a scathing review, confessing to loathing the film and describing it as "a rat's nest of a movie", which looks as if Clint "hadn't paid his Con Ed Bill". Others, particularly jazz enthusiasts, however, praised the music of the film and Eastwood received two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globes" title="Golden Globes">Golden Globes</a>â€”the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_B._DeMille_Award" title="Cecil B.

The film was not a major commercial success. earning just $11 million. Eastwood, who claimed he would have done the film biography even if the script was no good, was disappointed with the commercial reception of the film, later saying that, "We just didn't seem to have enough people in America who wanted to see the story of a black man who in the end betrays his genius. And we didn't get the support through black audiences that I'd hoped for. They really aren't into jazz now, you know. It's all this rap stuff. There aren't enough whites who are. either...".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carrey would later appear with Eastwood in the poorly received comedy <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Cadillac_(film)" title="Pink Cadillac (film)">Pink Cadillac</a></i> (1989) alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadette_Peters" title="Bernadette Peters">Bernadette Peters</a>.

The film was a disaster, both critically and commercially, earning just $12,143,484 and marking the lowest point in Eastwood's career in years, causing concern at Warners that Clint had peaked and was now faltering at the box office after three unsuccessful films. <i>Pink Cadillac</i> received poor reviews. Caryn James wrote: "When it's time to look back on the strange sweep of Clint Eastwood's career, from his ambitious direction of <i>Bird</i> to his coarse, classic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry" title="Dirty Harry">Dirty Harry</a> character, <i>Pink Cadillac</i> will probably settle comfortably near the bottom of the list. It is the laziest sort of action comedy, with lumbering chase scenes, a dull-witted script and the charmless pairing of Mr. Eastwood and Bernadette Peters." (<i>New York Times</i>, May 26, 1989.)</p>

The film was closely based on the novel, although the ending was changed to the killing of an elephant, even though in Huston's memoirs <i>An Open Book</i> (1980) he had claimed to never have killed an elephant in his life and believed it was "a sin". It received some critical attention but only had a limited release, earning just $8.4 million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Later in 1990, Eastwood directed and co-starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rookie_(1990_film)" title="The Rookie (1990 film)">The Rookie</a></i>, a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_cop" title="Buddy cop">buddy cop</a> action film. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ra%C3%BAl_Juli%C3%A1" title="RaÃºl JuliÃ¡">RaÃºl JuliÃ¡</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%B4nia_Braga" title="SÃ´nia Braga">SÃ´nia Braga</a> play German villains engaged in an illegal luxury car theft operation.

Released in December of that year, the film was a commercial success and earned a reasonable $43 million at the box office in the United States. 1991 was only the third year in 20 years of Eastwood's career where one of his films didn't appear in the cinemas. The reason for this was an on going law suit filed by Stacy McLaughlin, whose car Eastwood had rammed out of his parking space in the Malpaso parking lot. In the end Eastwood was victorious but agreed to pay McLaughlin's court fees if she agreed not to appeal.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood rose to prominence yet again in the early 1990s, rising above the lull in his career he had been experiencing for years, proving another benchmark in his career. In 1992, he revisited the western genre in the self-directed film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgiven" title="Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></i>, taking on the role of an aging ex-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunfighting" title="Gunfighting">gunfighter</a> long past his prime.

The idea for the film dated as far back as 1976 and originally went under the titles <i>The Cut-Whore Killings</i> and for a much longer period during the 1980s ran under the title, <i>The William Munny Killings</i>. The project was delayed, partly because Eastwood wanted to wait until he was old enough to play his character and to savour it as the last of his western films. The film, also starring such esteemed actors as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Hackman" title="Gene Hackman">Gene Hackman</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Harris" title="Richard Harris">Richard Harris</a> and then girlfriend <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher" title="Frances Fisher">Frances Fisher</a>, laid the groundwork for such later westerns as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadwood_(TV_series)" title="Deadwood (TV series)">Deadwood</a></i> by re-envisioning established genre conventions in a more ambiguous and unromantic light.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Unforgiven</i> was a great success both in terms of box office and critical acclaim. <i>Unforgiven</i> earned between $13 and $14 million in ticket sales in its opening weekend, becoming the best-ever opening for a Clint film.

The film received largely positive reviews, although some critics believed that the film at 138 minutes was too long. Janet Maslin of the <i>New York Times</i> believed the film was the highest point of Eastwood's directing career to date and remarked that "it gives real meaning to the subject of men's legacies to their children".

On the jury at Cannes that year were also two people very familiar to Eastwood, Catherine Deneuve (with whom he had an affair with back in the mid 1960s) and Lalo Schifrin who had composed most of the jazz tracks to his Dirty Harry films.</p>

The film was also a hit at the box-office and grossed $70 million in the United States. The film, unlike the novel, surprised film critics and was warmly received.

Advertising for the film became a source of controversy when Warner Bros.used elements of Jack Leigh's famous photograph in its movie posters without his permission. The film received a mixed response from critics and has a 52% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the <i>Chicago Sun Times</i> wrote, "I enjoyed the movie at a certain level simply as illustration: I was curious to see the Lady Chablis, and the famous old Mercer House where the murders took place, and the Spanish moss. But the movie never reaches takeoff speed; its energy was dissipated by being filtered through the deadpan character of Kelso."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1999, Eastwood directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Crime_(1999_film)" title="True Crime (1999 film)">True Crime</a></i>.

Everett discovers that Beechum might be innocent, but has only a few hours to prove his theory and save Beechum's life. The film was a large box-office bomb domestically, easily becoming his worst performing film of the 1990s. It had an opening weekend gross of $5,276,109 in the US and grossed $16,649,768 total in the US, out of a budget of $55 million. It received mixed reactions from critics, with a score of 51% on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. James Berardinelli wrote, "True Crime has the potential to be a truly memorable film, and, for more than three-quarters of its running time, it is poised to live up to that potential. But then there are the final twenty minutes, which proffer the almost-painful experience of watching compelling drama devolve into mindless action. True Crime's denouement is perplexing and exasperating, because, aside from generating some artificial tension, it contributes nothing to the story as a whole, and, consequently, serves only to cheapen it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2000, Eastwood directed and starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Cowboys" title="Space Cowboys">Space Cowboys</a></i>, which also starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Lee_Jones" title="Tommy Lee Jones">Tommy Lee Jones</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Sutherland" title="Donald Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Garner" title="James Garner">James Garner</a>.

The film received a moderately favorable review from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> who remarked, â€œit's too secure within its traditional story structure to make much seem at riskâ€”but with the structure come the traditional pleasures as well...

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 2006, Eastwood directed two films about the battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. The first one, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_Our_Fathers_(film)" title="Flags of Our Fathers (film)">Flags of Our Fathers</a></i>, focused on the men who raised the American flag on top of Mount Suribachi. The second one, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_from_Iwo_Jima" title="Letters from Iwo Jima">Letters from Iwo Jima</a></i>, dealt with the tactics of the Japanese soldiers on the island and the letters they wrote to family members. <i>Letters from Iwo Jima</i> was the first American film to show a war issue completely from the view of an American enemy. Both films were highly praised by critics and garnered several Oscar nominations, including Best Director and Best Picture for <i>Letters from Iwo Jima</i>. In 2008 Eastwood directed <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling_(film)" title="Changeling (film)">Changeling</a></i>, based on a true story starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After four years away from acting, Eastwood ended his "self-imposed acting hiatus" with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Torino" title="Gran Torino">Gran Torino</a></i>. It grossed close to $30 million during its wide-release opening weekend in January 2009, making Eastwood, at age 78, the oldest leading man to reach number one at the box office. Eastwood directed, starred, held a producer role, and co-wrote the theme song for the film. Biographer Marc Eliot called Eastwood's role "an amalgam of the Man with No Name, Dirty Harry, and William Munny, here aged and cynical but willing and able to fight on whenever the need arose." <i>Gran Torino</i> grossed over $268 million worldwide in theaters and is the highest-grossing film of Eastwood's career so far without adjustment for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation" title="Inflation">inflation</a>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Sarris" title="Andrew Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Observer" title="New York Observer">New York Observer</a></i> stated that Eastwood "... caps his career as both a director and an actor with his portrayal of a heroically redeemed bigot of such humanity and luminosity as to exhaust my supply of superlatives."

He usually describes himself as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian" title="Libertarian">libertarian</a> in interviews, fiscally conservative yet socially liberal. At times, he has supported Democrats in California, such as the liberal and environmentally concerned Representative <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Farr" title="Sam Farr">Sam Farr</a> in 2002. Eastwood contributed $1,000 to Farr's successful re-election campaign that year and on May 23, 2003 hosted a $5,000-per-ticket fundraiser for California's Democratic governor, Gray Davis. Later that year, Eastwood offered to film a commercial in support of the embattled governor, while in 2001, the star visited Davis' office to support an alternative energy bill written by another Democrat, California State Assemblyman Fred Keeley.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In general, Eastwood has favored less governmental interference in both the private economy and the private lives of individuals. He has disapproved of a reliance on welfare, instead feeling that government should help citizens make something of themselves via education and incentive. He has, however, approved of unemployment insurance, bail-outs for homeowners saddled with unaffordable mortgages, a continued American automobile industry, electric and hybrid cars, free prescription drugs, government-ordained educational standards, environmental conservation, land preservation, alternative energy, and gun control measures such as California's Brady Bill. A longtime liberal on civil rights, Eastwood has stated that he has always been pro-choice on abortion (see the March 1997 edition of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Magazine" title="Playboy Magazine">Playboy</a></i>). He has also endorsed the notion of allowing gays to marry, just as he had once contributed to groups supporting the Equal Rights Amendment for women.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood disapproved of America's wars in Korea (1950â€“1953), Vietnam (1964â€“1973), and Iraq (2003â€“present), believing that the U.S. should not be overly militaristic or play the role of global policeman. In all, he considers himself too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing, having sometimes described himself as a "political nothing" and a "moderate" (see the February 1974 edition of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playboy_Magazine" title="Playboy Magazine">Playboy</a></i>). Eastwood has stated while that he doesn't see himself as conservative, he isn't "ultra-leftist," either.</p>

Although sympathetic towards her bid for the presidency, Eastwood expressed disappointment with Hillary Clinton for engaging in a duck-hunting photo op, saying, "I was thinking: 'The poor duck, what the hell did she do that for?' I don't go for hunting. I just don't like killing creatures. Unless they're trying to kill me. Then that would be fine." Upon the election of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>, Eastwood stated "Obama is my president now and I am going to be wishing him the very best because it is what is best for all of us."</p>

Biographers and friend Paul Lippman have claimed that Eastwood was particularly sexually promiscuous in the 1970s and that he used his apartment close to the <i>Hog's Breath Inn</i> which he purchased in Carmel in the early 1970s to meet young ladies for "nooners" and "five in the afternooners." According to Lippman, "Eastwood seemed to get a bang out of this kinkier side to himself and rarely concealed it, often gloated about it."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood married swimsuit model Maggie Johnson on December 19, 1953, six months after they met on a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blind_date" title="wikt:blind date">blind date</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his marriage to Johnson, Eastwood had an affair with Roxanne Tunis, who was an extra on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide" title="Rawhide">Rawhide</a></i>. The affair produced a daughter, Kimber, born on June 17, 1964. Over the years, Eastwood financially supported Tunis and their daughter, and would secretly visit them every three to four months, according to Kimber. Kimber's existence was unknown to the public and even Eastwood's family until reported by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Enquirer" title="National Enquirer">National Enquirer</a> in 1989. Since then Kimber has had a small role in her father's film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Power_(film)" title="Absolute Power (film)">Absolute Power</a></i>. Eastwood's grandson by Kimber is Clinton Eastwood-Gaddie (born February 21, 1984).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon initially learning he fathered a child with Tunis, Eastwood reportedly asked Johnson for a divorce. Johnson then became ill with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatitis" title="Hepatitis">hepatitis</a>, and after she recovered, he changed his mind. They subsequently had two children together: <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Eastwood" title="Kyle Eastwood">Kyle Eastwood</a> (born May 19, 1968) and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alison_Eastwood" title="Alison Eastwood">Alison Eastwood</a> (born May 22, 1972). They separated around 1976 when Eastwood began living with actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondra_Locke" title="Sondra Locke">Sondra Locke</a>, but Johnson did not take any legal action until 1978, when she filed for a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_separation" title="Legal separation">legal separation</a>. Eastwood was ordered to pay her $25 million. Their divorce was not finalized until May 1984.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood's relationship with Locke lasted 14 years and the couple co-starred in six films: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outlaw_Josey_Wales" title="The Outlaw Josey Wales">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gauntlet_(film)" title="The Gauntlet (film)">The Gauntlet</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Which_Way_but_Loose_(film)" title="Every Which Way but Loose (film)">Every Which Way but Loose</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronco_Billy" title="Bronco Billy">Bronco Billy</a></i>, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Any_Which_Way_You_Can" title="Any Which Way You Can">Any Which Way You Can</a></i>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_Impact" title="Sudden Impact">Sudden Impact</a></i>. Locke became pregnant by Eastwood twice, had two <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortions" title="Abortions">abortions</a> (she later wrote it was "a mutual decision") and then a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubal_ligation" title="Tubal ligation">tubal ligation</a> (at Eastwood's request, she says). The couple separated acrimoniously in 1989. While Locke was away directing the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(1990_film)" title="Impulse (1990 film)">Impulse</a></i>, Eastwood had the locks changed on the home they shared and placed all of her belongings into a storage facility. She filed a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palimony" title="Palimony">palimony</a> suit against Eastwood, and the litigation continued for a decade, with Locke suing him a second time for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud" title="Fraud">fraud</a>. Locke and Eastwood finally resolved the dispute with a non-public settlement in 1999. She published a memoir, <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly</i>, which includes a harrowing account of their years together.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his cohabitation with Locke, Eastwood also had an affair with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_attendant" title="Flight attendant">flight attendant</a> Jacelyn Reeves. According to biographers, they met at the premiere of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pale_Rider" title="Pale Rider">Pale Rider</a></i> and conceived a son, Scott (b. March 21, 1986), the same night. Since Reeves made no demands of Eastwood, he repeated the experience with her, which produced a daughter, Kathryn (b. 2 February 1988). The fact that Scott and Kathryn Reeves were the actor's children was not publicly known until a Carmel reporter revealed the information years after they were born. Since then, the son (now known as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Eastwood" title="Scott Eastwood">Scott Eastwood</a>) has become an actor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Upon breaking up with Locke, actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Fisher" title="Frances Fisher">Frances Fisher</a> moved in with Eastwood. They had met while filming <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Cadillac_(film)" title="Pink Cadillac (film)">Pink Cadillac</a></i> in 1988. They co-starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unforgiven" title="Unforgiven">Unforgiven</a></i> and had a daughter, Francesca Fisher-Eastwood (born August 7, 1993). The couple ended their relationship in early 1995, but remain friends later appeared together in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Crime_(1999_film)" title="True Crime (1999 film)">True Crime</a></i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After initially meeting in an interview in 1993, Eastwood married anchorwoman <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dina_Eastwood" title="Dina Eastwood">Dina Ruiz</a> on March 31, 1996, in Las Vegas when Eastwood surprised her with a private ceremony at a home on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_Creek_Golf_Course" title="Shadow Creek Golf Course">Shadow Creek Golf Course</a>. She is 35 years his junior. The couple's daughter, Morgan Eastwood, was born on December 12, 1996. Ruiz commented, "The fact that I am only the second woman he has married really touches me." Eastwood says that she has brought his family close together, and Ruiz maintains a friendly relationship with Eastwood's other children and their mothers. He professes to be a much better father now at his age than when he was younger and worked constantly.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood, an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audiophile" title="Audiophile">audiophile</a>, has had a strong passion for music since a young age, particularly a love of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz" title="Jazz">jazz</a>, and he is also a country and western enthusiast. He dabbled in music early on and in late 1959 had produced the album <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cowboy_Favorites&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="Cowboy Favorites (page does not exist)">Cowboy Favorites</a></i> which was released on the Cameo label.

Later in 1963, Cameo producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kal_Mann" title="Kal Mann">Kal Mann</a> would bluntly tell him that "he would never make it big as a singer". Neverless, during the off season of filming <i>Rawhide</i>, Eastwood and Brinegar, sometimes joined by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheb_Wooley" title="Sheb Wooley">Sheb Wooley</a> would go on touring rodeos, state fairs and festivals and in 1962 their act entitled <i>Amusement Business Cavalcade of Fairs</i> earned them as much as $15,000 a performance. Eastwood has his own <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros._Records" title="Warner Bros. Records">Warner Bros.

This deal was unchanged when <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Music_Group" title="Warner Music Group">Warner Music Group</a> was sold by Time Warner to private investors. Malpaso has released all of the scores of Eastwood's films from <i>The Bridges of Madison County</i> onward. It also released the album of a 1996 jazz concert he hosted, titled <i>Eastwood after HoursÂ â€” Live at Carnegie Hall</i>. Eastwood also owns an extensive collection of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_album" title="LP album">LPs</a> which he plays on a Rockport <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph" title="Phonograph">turntable</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood, a life-long non-smoker, has been conscious of his health and fitness since he was a teenager, and has practiced healthy eating ever since. As he made a name for himself during the production of <i>Rawhide</i>, Eastwood would frequently feature in magazines and journals, which often documented his healthy lifestyle. In the August 1959 edition of <i>TV Guide</i>, for example, Eastwood was photographed doing push-ups and gave tips on fitness and nutrition, telling people to eat plenty of fruit, raw vegetables and vitamins and to avoid sugar-loaded beverages and excess alcohol drinking and overloading on carbohydrates.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On July 21, 1970, Eastwood's father died of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>, unexpectedly at the age of 64. It came as a shock to Eastwood as his grandfather had lived to 92 and had a profound impact on Eastwood's life, described by Fritz Manes as "the only bad thing that ever happened to him in his life". From this moment he became viewed as more productive, working with a greater sense of urgency, speed and efficiency on set to this day. Although Eastwood had always been a health and fitness enthusiast, he became increasingly more so after his father's death, abstaining from hard liquor, adopting a more rigorous health regime and seeking to stay fit. However, he still favored cold beer and opened a pub called the <i>Hog Breath's Inn</i> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel-by-the-Sea,_California" title="Carmel-by-the-Sea, California">Carmel-by-the-Sea</a> in 1971.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i><b>Million Dollar Baby</b></i> is a 2004 American film directed, co-produced, and scored by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Eastwood" title="Clint Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> and starring Eastwood, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilary_Swank" title="Hilary Swank">Hilary Swank</a>, and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Freeman" title="Morgan Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>. It is the story of an under-appreciated boxing trainer, his elusive past, and his quest for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atonement" title="Atonement">atonement</a> by helping an underdog amateur female boxer (the film's title character) achieve her dream of becoming a professional. The film won four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Awards</a>, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Picture" title="Academy Award for Best Picture">Best Picture</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The screenplay was written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Haggis" title="Paul Haggis">Paul Haggis</a>, based on short stories by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.X._Toole" title="F.X. Toole">F.X. Toole</a>, the pen name of fight manager and "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutman" title="Cutman">cutman</a>" Jerry Boyd. Originally published under the title <i>Rope Burns,</i> the stories have since been republished under the film's title.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Margaret Fitzgerald, a waitress and aspiring boxer, leaves her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri" title="Missouri">Missouri</a> town in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozarks" title="Ozarks">Ozarks</a> for Los Angeles, where she trains in the Hit Pit, a gym run by Frankie Dunn, a brilliant but down-and-out boxing trainer who has been cast aside by his colleagues and relatives, including his estranged daughter Katy. Dunn initially refuses to train Maggie because she is a woman and almost 32 years old. Maggie, however, perseveres in her attempts to win Dunn over by training each day in his gym, even when others discourage her. Frank's friend and employee, ex-boxer Eddie "Scrap Iron" Dupris narrates the story in non-dialogue scenes.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Dunn eventually agrees to train Maggie, she fights her way up to the women's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welterweight" title="Welterweight">welterweight</a> boxing division, winning many of her fights with first-round knockouts. Lacking a close relationship with his own daughter, who returns his letters unopened, Dunn comes to establish a strong bond with Maggie, whose own family cares little for her well-being. When Maggie buys her mother a house with some of her winnings, she berates Maggie for risking her and Maggie's sister's welfare and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid" title="Medicaid">Medicaid</a> benefits, saying that Maggie should have just given her the cash so that the government would not be aware that she had assets. In addition, her mother mocks her success in the ring, saying that everyone is laughing at her at home for what she's doing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eventually, Dunn secures Maggie a $1 million title match in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas,_Nevada" title="Las Vegas, Nevada">Las Vegas</a> against the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Boxing_Association" title="World Boxing Association">WBA</a> women's welterweight champion, Billie the Blue Bear, a German ex-prostitute who is known as a dirty fighter. After a shaky start, Maggie begins to dominate the fight, but after a round has ended, Billie hits her from behind, sending her falling toward the upside-down corner stool that was just placed in the ring. Before Dunn can pull the stool out of the way, Maggie lands on it and breaks her neck, leaving her a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriplegic" title="Quadriplegic">quadriplegic</a>. Dunn initially blames Scrap for convincing him to train Maggie, but in the end he blames himself for having worked with her against his better judgment.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a medical rehabilitation facility, Maggie hopes that her family will visit her, though Dunn repeatedly calls them with no success. Eventually, the family arrives - after first visiting <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disneyland_Park_(Anaheim)" title="Disneyland Park (Anaheim)">Disneyland</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Studios_Hollywood" title="Universal Studios Hollywood">Universal Studios Hollywood</a> - with an attorney in tow, to arrange the transfer of Maggie's assets to them. Knowing that her family never signed the title to the house she gave them, Maggie offers them a choice: leave and never contact her again, or Maggie will sell the house and leave them homeless. Her defeated family leaves and does not return.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As time goes on, Maggie develops bedsores and undergoes an amputation for her infected leg, furthering her depression. Maggie asks Dunn to be relieved of her suffering and help her die. Dunn refuses, but does speak with his priest, who objects to the idea of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a>, sympathetically but firmly saying that it is murder. Maggie then attempts suicide by biting her tongue multiple times in an attempt to bleed to death. Though hospital staff prevent further suicide attempts, Dunn decides that Maggie's suffering should not continue, and he injects her with an overdose of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine" title="Epinephrine">adrenaline</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Just before administering the injection, Dunn finally tells Maggie the meaning of the nickname by which he has called her; the phrase, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macushla" title="Macushla">Mo Chuisle</a></i> (spelled incorrectly in the film as "mo cuishle"), which is <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a> for "my darling, and my blood" (literally, "my pulse"). Afterwards, as Scrap explains, Dunn disappears. Scrap's narration is revealed to be a letter to Dunn's daughter, Katy, informing her of her father's true character.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was stuck in so-called "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_hell" title="Development hell">development hell</a>" for years before it was shot. Several studios rejected the project even when Eastwood signed on as actor and director. Even Warner Bros., Eastwood's longtime home base, wouldn't agree to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar" title="United States dollar">USD</a>$30 million budget. Eastwood persuaded Lakeshore Entertainment's Tom Rosenberg to put up half the budget (as well as handle foreign distribution), with Warner Bros. kicking in the rest ($15 million). Eastwood shot the film in 37 days.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite an opening weekend of just $12,265,482 in North America, the film became a box-office hit both domestically and internationally. The film grossed $216,763,646 in theaters---$100,492,203 in the United States and $116,271,443 overseas. The film played in theaters for six and a half months.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film received highly positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars and stated that "Clint Eastwood's <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> is a masterpiece, pure and simple," listing it as the best film of 2004. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Medved" title="Michael Medved">Michael Medved</a> stated that: "My main objection to <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> always centered on its misleading marketing, and effort by Warner Brothers to sell it as a movie about a female <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocky" title="Rocky">Rocky</a></i>, with barely a hint of the pitch-dark substance that led Andrew Sarris of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Observer" title="New York Observer">New York Observer</a></i> to declare that 'no movie in my memory has depressed me more than <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>.'"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January and February 2005, the film sparked controversy when some <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_rights_movement" title="Disability rights movement">disability rights activists</a> protested against the ending, in which Frank carries out Maggie's wish to die after she becomes a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadriplegic" title="Quadriplegic">quadriplegic</a> as a result of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal-cord_injury" title="Spinal-cord injury">spinal-cord injury</a>. The activists believed that the ending supported the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasia" title="Euthanasia">euthanasia</a> of disabled people. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_J._Smith" title="Wesley J. Smith">Wesley J. Smith</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weekly_Standard" title="The Weekly Standard">The Weekly Standard</a></i> also criticized the film for its ending and for missed opportunities; Smith said, "The movie could have ended with Maggie triumphing once again, perhaps having obtained an education and becoming a teacher; or, opening a business managing boxers; or perhaps, receiving a standing ovation as an inspirational speaker."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Eastwood responded to the criticism by saying the film was about the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_dream" title="American dream">American dream</a>. In an interview with the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i>, Eastwood distanced himself from the actions of characters in his films, noting, "I've gone around in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_Harry_(film_series)" title="Dirty Harry (film series)">movies</a> blowing people away with a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.44_magnum" title=".44 magnum">.44 magnum</a>. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do". <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> of the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun_Times" title="Chicago Sun Times">Chicago Sun Times</a></i>, who named the film his favorite of 2004, believes "a movie is not good or bad because of its content, but because of how it handles its content. <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> is classical in the clean, clear, strong lines of its story and characters, and had an enormous emotional impact".</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_language" title="Irish language">Irish</a> speakers have also criticized the fact that the phrase <i>Mo Chuisle</i>, a term of endearment meaning <i>My pulse</i>, was misspelled in the film as <i>Mo Cuishle</i>, as shown on the back of Maggie's robe. In Irish and other <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goidelic_language" title="Goidelic language">Goidelic languages</a>, consonants <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenition" title="Lenition">soften</a> when followed by a vowel, hence the "c" in "cuisle" turns into a guttural "ch". It is translated in the film as "My darling, my blood". The original phrase is short for <i>A chuisle mo chroÃ­</i>, meaning "O pulse of my heart". The film has also been praised for stirring interest in the Irish language in the U.S.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When describing the plot of the film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiler_(media)" title="Spoiler (media)">spoiler</a> warning. He noted in his reviews the difficulty of discussing the film without discussing details of the plot, saying that even warning about spoilers would itself be a spoiler. Susan Wloszczyna of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> said the film "packs a surprise plot twist" and said "spoilsports already have begun to leak details about this drama", saying "the urge to divulge the story's secrets will only grow worse when the film finally goes nationwide." Wloszczyna noted that David Thomson of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent" title="The Independent">The Independent</a></i> "offered readers only a hint of the story basics" and said "most reviewers have coddled the sports saga with similar care..."

Mark Moring of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_Today" title="Christianity Today">Christianity Today</a></i> said, "Who wants to watch a movie when you know how it ends? We've actually had to wrestle with that question around here lately..." Moring said, "We wondered if our "moral obligation" to warn <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian" title="Christian">Christians</a> about the potentially disturbing subject matter somehow "trumped" our professional commitment to avoid plot spoilers â€” especially the worst plot spoiler of all: divulging the end. After some discussion, we agreed that the right decision was to not give away the end to <i>Million Dollar Baby</i>."</p>
