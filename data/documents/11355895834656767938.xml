	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rooney was born <b>Joseph Yule, Jr.</b> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn,_New_York" title="Brooklyn, New York">Brooklyn, New York</a>, to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> family. His father, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Yule" title="Joe Yule">Joseph Yule</a>, was from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, and his mother, Nellie W. (nÃ©e Carter), was from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="Kansas City, Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. Both of his parents were in vaudeville, and appearing in a Brooklyn production of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Gaiety_Girl" title="A Gaiety Girl">A Gaiety Girl</a></i> when Joseph, Jr. was born. He began performing at the age of 17 months as part of his parents' routine, wearing a specially tailored tuxedo.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Yules separated in 1924 during a slump in vaudeville, and in 1925, Nell Yule moved with her son to Hollywood, where she managed a tourist home. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontaine_Fox" title="Fontaine Fox">Fontaine Fox</a> had placed a newspaper ad for a dark-haired child to play the role of "Mickey McGuire" in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_McGuire_(film_series)" title="Mickey McGuire (film series)">series of short films</a>. Lacking the money to have her son's hair dyed, Mrs. Yule took her son to the audition after applying burnt cork to his scalp. Joe got the role and became "Mickey" for 78 of the comedies, running from 1927 to 1936, starting with <i>Mickey's Circus</i>, released September 4, 1927. These had been adapted from the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toonerville_Folks" title="Toonerville Folks">Toonerville Trolley</a></i> comic strip, which contained a character named Mickey McGuire. Joe Yule briefly became "Mickey McGuire" legally in order to trump an attempted copyright lawsuit (as it was his legal name, the movie producers did not owe the comic strip writers royalties).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rooney later claimed that, during his Mickey McGuire days, he met cartoonist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney" title="Walt Disney">Walt Disney</a> at the Warner Brothers studio, and that Disney was inspired to name <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> after him, although Disney always said that he had changed the name from "Mortimer Mouse" to "Mickey Mouse" on the suggestion of his wife.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During an interruption in the series in 1932, Mrs. Yule made plans to take her son on a ten-week vaudeville tour as McGuire, and Fox sued successfully to stop him from using the name. Mrs. Yule suggested the stage name of "Mickey Looney" for her comedian son, which he altered slightly to Rooney, a less frivolous version. Rooney did other films in his adolescence, including several more of the McGuire films, and signed with MGM in 1934. MGM cast Rooney as the teenage son of a judge in 1937's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Family_Affair_(film)" title="A Family Affair (film)">A Family Affair</a></i>, setting Rooney on the way to another successful film series.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1937, Rooney was selected to portray <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hardy" title="Andy Hardy">Andy Hardy</a> in <i>A Family Affair</i> (1937), which MGM had planned as a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-movie" title="B-movie">B-movie</a>. Rooney provided comic relief as the son of Judge James K. Hardy, portrayed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a> (although <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Stone" title="Lewis Stone">Lewis Stone</a> would play the role of Judge Hardy in later films). The film was an unexpected success, and led to thirteen more "Andy Hardy" films between 1937 and 1946, and a final film in 1958. Rooney also received top billing as Shockey Carter in <i>Hoosier Schoolboy</i> (1937).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also in 1937, Mickey made his first film alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a> with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbreds_Don%27t_Cry" title="Thoroughbreds Don't Cry">Thoroughbreds Don't Cry</a></i>. Garland and Rooney became close friends and a successful song and dance team. Besides three of the Andy Hardy films, where she portrayed Betsy Booth, a younger girl with a crush on Andy, they appeared together in a string of successful musicals, including the Oscar-nominated <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babes_in_Arms_(film)" title="Babes in Arms (film)">Babes in Arms</a></i> (1939).</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rooney's breakthrough role as a dramatic actor came in 1938's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boys_Town_(1938_film)" title="Boys Town (1938 film)">Boys Town</a></i> opposite <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a> as Whitey Marsh, which opened shortly before his 18th birthday. Rooney was named the biggest box-office draw in 1939, 1940 and 1941. Unquestionably a well-known entertainer by the early 1940s Rooney, with Garland, was one of many celebrities caricatured in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tex_Avery" title="Tex Avery">Tex Avery</a>'s 1941 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon" title="Cartoon">cartoon</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Steps_Out" title="Hollywood Steps Out">Hollywood Steps Out</a></i>. As of today, Rooney is the only surviving entertainer depicted in the cartoon.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1944, Rooney entered military service. He served more than 21 months, until shortly after the end of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. During and after the war he helped entertain the troops in America and Europe, and spent part of the time as a radio personality on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Forces_Network" title="American Forces Network">American Forces Network</a>. After his return to civilian life, his career slumped. He appeared in a number of films, including <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_and_Music_(1948_film)" title="Words and Music (1948 film)">Words and Music</a></i> in 1948, which paired him for the last time with Garland on film (he appeared with her on one episode as a guest on her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> variety series in 1963). He briefly starred in a CBS radio series, <i>Shorty Bell</i>, in the summer of 1948, and reprised his role as "Andy Hardy", with most of the original cast, in a syndicated radio version of <i>The Hardy Family</i> in 1949 and 1950 (repeated on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual" title="Mutual">Mutual</a> during 1952). His first television series, <i>The Mickey Rooney Show</i>, also known as <i>Hey Mulligan</i> (which Rooney also produced), appeared on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> television for 32 episodes from August 1954 through June 1955. In 1951, he directed a feature film for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, <i>My True Story</i> starring <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Walker" title="Helen Walker">Helen Walker</a>. Rooney also starred as a ragingly egomaniacal television comedian in the live 90-minute television drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Comedian_(1957_TV_drama)" title="The Comedian (1957 TV drama)">The Comedian</a></i>, in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playhouse_90" title="Playhouse 90">Playhouse 90</a></i> series on the evening of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day" title="Valentine's Day">Valentine's Day</a> in 1957, and as himself in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revue" title="Revue">revue</a> called <i>The Musical Revue Of 1959</i> based on the 1929 movie <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Revue_Of_1929" title="The Hollywood Revue Of 1929">The Hollywood Revue Of 1929</a></i> which was edited into a film in 1960, by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_International_Pictures" title="British International Pictures">British International Pictures</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1960, he directed and starred in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Private_Lives_of_Adam_and_Eve_(film)" title="The Private Lives of Adam and Eve (film)">The Private Lives of Adam and Eve</a></i>, an ambitious comedy known for its multiple flashbacks and many cameos. In the 1960s, Rooney returned to theatrical entertainment. He still accepted film roles in undistinguished movies, but occasionally would appear in better works, such as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_a_Heavyweight" title="Requiem for a Heavyweight">Requiem for a Heavyweight</a></i> (1962), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_A_Mad,_Mad,_Mad,_Mad_World" title="It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World">It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a></i> (1963), and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Stallion_(film)" title="The Black Stallion (film)">The Black Stallion</a></i> (1979). One of Rooney's more controversial roles came in the highly acclaimed 1961 film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_at_Tiffany%27s_(film)" title="Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a></i> where he played a stereotyped buck-toothed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia" title="Myopia">myopic</a> Japanese neighbor (Mr. Yunioshi) of the main character, Holly Golightly. Producer Richard Shepherd apologized for this in the 45th anniversary DVD, though Director Blake Edwards and Rooney himself do not.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On December 31, 1961, he appeared on television's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What%27s_My_Line" title="What's My Line">What's My Line</a></i> and mentioned that he had already started enrolling students in the MRSE (Mickey Rooney School of Entertainment). His school venture never came to fruition, but for several years he was a spokesman/partner in Pennsylvania's Downingtown Inn, a country club and golf resort.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1966, while Rooney was working on the film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambush_Bay" title="Ambush Bay">Ambush Bay</a></i> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Philippines" title="The Philippines">the Philippines</a>, his wife Barbara Ann Thomason (aka Tara Thomas, Carolyn Mitchell), a former pin-up model and aspiring actress who had won 17 straight beauty contests in Southern California, was found dead in their bed. Beside her was her lover, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milos_Milos" title="Milos Milos">Milos Milos</a>, an actor friend of Rooney's. Detectives ruled it <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder-suicide" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a>, which was committed with Rooney's own gun.</p>
