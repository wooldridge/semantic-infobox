	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The story begins in the early years of a young schizophrenic prodigy named John Nash. Early in the movie, Nash begins developing <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoid_schizophrenia" title="Paranoid schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a> and endures <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion" title="Delusion">delusional</a> episodes while painfully watching the loss and burden his condition brings on his wife and friends.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film opened in US cinemas on December 21, 2001. It was well-received by critics, grossed over $170 million worldwide, and went on to win four <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Awards</a>, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actress. It was also nominated for Best Leading Actor, Best Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Score. The film has been criticized for its inaccurate portrayal of some aspects of Nash's life. The film fictionally portrayed his hallucinations as visual and auditory, when in fact they were exclusively auditory. Also, Nasar concluded that Nash's refusal to take drugs "may have been fortunate," since their <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_effect_(medicine)" title="Adverse effect (medicine)">side effects</a> "would have made his gentle re-entry into the world of mathematics a near impossibility"; in the screenplay, however, just before he receives the Nobel Prize, Nash speaks of taking "newer medications."</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1947, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr." title="John Forbes Nash, Jr.">John Nash</a> (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Crowe" title="Russell Crowe">Russell Crowe</a>) arrives at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> as a new graduate student. He is a recipient of the prestigious Carnegie Prize for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics" title="Mathematics">mathematics</a>; although he was promised a single room, his roommate Charles Herman (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bettany" title="Paul Bettany">Paul Bettany</a>), a literature student, greets him as he moves in and soon becomes his best friend. Nash also meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Martin Hansen (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Lucas" title="Josh Lucas">Josh Lucas</a>), Richard Sol (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Goldberg" title="Adam Goldberg">Adam Goldberg</a>), Ainsley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Gray-Stanford" title="Jason Gray-Stanford">Jason Gray-Stanford</a>), and Bender (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Rapp" title="Anthony Rapp">Anthony Rapp</a>), with whom he strikes up an awkward friendship. Nash admits to Charles that he is better with numbers than he is with people.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The mathematics department chairman of Princeton informs Nash, who has missed many of his classes, that he cannot begin work until he finishes a thesis paper, prompting him to seek a truly original idea for the paper. A woman at the bar is what ultimately inspires his fruitful work in the concept of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" title="Nash equilibrium">governing dynamics</a>, a theory in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_economics" title="Mathematical economics">mathematical economics</a>. After the conclusion of Nash's studies as a student at Princeton, he accepts a prestigious appointment at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT), along with his friends Sol and Bender.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1953, while teaching a class on calculus at MIT, he places a particularly interesting problem on the chalkboard that he dares his students to solve. He is not particularly interested in teaching and his delusions even cause him to miss the class. When a student, Alicia Larde (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" title="Jennifer Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a>), comes to his office to discuss why he did not show up, she also asks him to dinner and the two fall in love and eventually marry.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into his former roommate Charles and meets Charles' young niece Marcee (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Cardone" title="Vivien Cardone">Vivien Cardone</a>), whom he adores. Nash is invited to a secret Department of Defense facility in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon" title="The Pentagon">the Pentagon</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis" title="Cryptanalysis">crack</a> a complex <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption" title="Encryption">encryption</a> of an enemy telecommunication. Nash is able to decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other codebreakers. Here, he encounters the mysterious William Parcher (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Harris" title="Ed Harris">Ed Harris</a>), who belongs to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense" title="United States Department of Defense">United States Department of Defense</a>. Parcher observes Nash's performance from above, while partially concealed behind a screen. Parcher gives Nash a new assignment to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers, ostensibly to thwart a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> plot. He must write a report of his findings and place them in a specified mailbox. After being chased by Soviet agents and an exchange of gunfire, Nash becomes increasingly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranoia" title="Paranoia">paranoid</a> and begins to behave erratically.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After observing this erratic behavior, Alicia informs a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric hospital</a>. Later, while delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash realizes that he is being watched by a hostile group of people, and although he attempts to flee, he is forcibly sedated and sent to a psychiatric facility. Nash's internment seemingly confirms his belief that the Soviets are trying to extract information from him. He views the officials of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric_hospital" title="Psychiatric hospital">psychiatric facility</a> as Soviet kidnappers. At one point, he gorily tries to dig out of his arm an implant he received at an unused warehouse on the MIT campus which was supposedly used as a listening facility by the DoD.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alicia, desperate and obligated to help her husband, visits the mailbox and retrieves the never-opened "top secret" documents that Nash had delivered there. When confronted with this evidence, Nash is finally convinced that he has been hallucinating. The Department of Defense agent William Parcher and Nash's secret assignment to decode Soviet messages was in fact all a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delusion" title="Delusion">delusion</a>. Even more surprisingly, Nash's "prodigal roommate" Charles and his niece Marcee are also products of his mind.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After a series of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_shock_therapy" title="Insulin shock therapy">insulin shock therapy</a> sessions, Nash is released on the condition that he agrees to take <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> medication; however, the drugs create <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_drug_reaction" title="Adverse drug reaction">negative side-effects</a> that affect his sexual and emotional relationship with his wife and, most dramatically, his intellectual capacity. Frustrated, Nash secretly stops taking his medication and hoards his pills, triggering a relapse of his psychosis.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Caught between the intellectual paralysis of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychotic" title="Antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a> drugs and his delusions, Nash and Alicia decide to try to live with his <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia" title="Schizophrenia">abnormal condition</a>. Nash consciously says goodbye to the three delusional characters forever in his attempts to ignore his hallucinations and not feed "his demons". He thanks Charles for being his best friend over the years, and says a tearful goodbye to Marcee, stroking her hair and calling her "baby girl", telling them both he would not speak to them anymore. They still continue to haunt him, with Charles mocking him for cutting off their friendship, but Nash learns to ignore them.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nash eventually earns the privilege of teaching again. In 1994, Nash is honored by his fellow professors for his achievement in mathematics, and goes on to win the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Sweden_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences_in_Memory_of_Alfred_Nobel" title="Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics</a> for his revolutionary work on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory" title="Game theory">game theory</a>. Nash and Alicia are about to leave the auditorium in Stockholm, when Nash sees Charles, Marcee and Parcher standing and watching him with blank expressions on their faces. Alicia asks Nash, "What is it?" Nash replies, "Nothing. Nothing at all." With that, they both leave the auditorium.</p>

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Production">Production</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Grazer" title="Brian Grazer">Brian Grazer</a> first read an excerpt of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Nasar" title="Sylvia Nasar">Sylvia Nasar</a>'s book <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Beautiful_Mind_(book)" title="A Beautiful Mind (book)">A Beautiful Mind</a></i> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i>. Grazer immediately purchased the rights to the film. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later said that many <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-list" title="A-list">A-list</a> directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was only available at the same time Howard was available. Grazer was forced to make a decision and chose Howard.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Grazer then met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of "serious dramatists", but he chose <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_Goldsman" title="Akiva Goldsman">Akiva Goldsman</a> instead, because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to not allow the viewers to understand that they are viewing an alternate reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their feelings in the same way that Nash himself was. Howard agreed to direct the film based only on the first draft. He then requested that Goldsman accentuate the love story aspect.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dave Bayer, a professor of Mathematics at Barnard College, Columbia University, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. Bayer later stated that he approached his consulting role as an actor when preparing equations, such as when Nash is forced to teach a calculus class, and arbitrarily places a complicated problem on the blackboard. Bayer focused on a character who did not want to teach ordinary details and was more concerned with what was interesting. Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor that lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Cannom" title="Greg Cannom">Greg Cannom</a> was chosen to create the makeup effects for <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, specifically the age progression of the characters. Russell Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Insider_(film)" title="The Insider (film)">The Insider</a></i>. Howard had also worked with Cannom on <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocoon_(film)" title="Cocoon (film)">Cocoon</a></i>. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of "Older Nash". It was originally decided that the makeup department would merely age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup purposefully pulled Crowe's look towards the facial features of the real John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate real skin and be used for overlapping applications, shortening the application time from eight hours to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malocclusion" title="Malocclusion">overbite</a> throughout the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner" title="James Horner">James Horner</a> to score the film because of familiarity and his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, "It's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director." A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaleidoscope" title="Kaleidoscope">kaleidoscope</a>, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: "I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems." He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Church" title="Charlotte Church">Charlotte Church</a> to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a "purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument" but also a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrato" title="Vibrato">vibrato</a> to maintain the humanity of the voice.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University" title="Princeton University">Princeton University</a> campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always first be introduced audibly and then visually. This not only provides a visual clue, but establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The real John Nash's delusions were also only auditory. A technique was also developed to visualize Nash's epiphanies. After speaking to a number of mathematicians who described it as "the smoke clearing", "flashes of light" and "everything coming together", the filmmakers decided upon a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work. Two night shots were done at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairleigh_Dickinson_University" title="Fairleigh Dickinson University">Fairleigh Dickinson University</a>'s campus in Florham Park, NJ, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Many actors were considered for the role of John Nash, including <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Willis" title="Bruce Willis">Bruce Willis</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Costner" title="Kevin Costner">Kevin Costner</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Travolta" title="John Travolta">John Travolta</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise" title="Tom Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cusack" title="John Cusack">John Cusack</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Sheen" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr." title="Robert Downey Jr.">Robert Downey Jr.</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage" title="Nicolas Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Depp" title="Johnny Depp">Johnny Depp</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Fiennes" title="Ralph Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Leto" title="Jared Leto">Jared Leto</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Pitt" title="Brad Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alec_Baldwin" title="Alec Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Penn" title="Sean Penn">Sean Penn</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Pearce" title="Guy Pearce">Guy Pearce</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Broderick" title="Matthew Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Oldman" title="Gary Oldman">Gary Oldman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keanu_Reeves" title="Keanu Reeves">Keanu Reeves</a>.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The producers had not originally thought of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Connelly" title="Jennifer Connelly">Jennifer Connelly</a> for the role of Alicia.

      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Divergence_from_actual_events">Divergence from actual events</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The narrative of the film differs considerably from the actual events of Nash's life. The film has been criticized for this, but the filmmakers had consistently said that the film was not meant to be a literal representation. One difficulty was in portraying stress and mental illness within one person's mind. Sylvia Nasar stated that the filmmakers "invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story". The film made his hallucinations visual and auditory when, in fact, they were exclusively auditory. Furthermore, while in real life Nash spent his years between Princeton and MIT as a consultant for the RAND Corporation in California, in the film he is portrayed to have worked for the Pentagon instead. It is true that his handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS" title="PBS">PBS</a> documentary <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Brilliant_Madness" title="A Brilliant Madness">A Brilliant Madness</a></i> attempts to portray his life more accurately.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The differences were substantial. Few if any of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, corresponded directly to actual people. The discussion of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium" title="Nash equilibrium">Nash equilibrium</a> was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, schizophrenic hallucinations appeared while he was in graduate school, when in fact they did not show up until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's supposed homosexual experiences at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND" title="RAND">RAND</a>, which Nash and his wife both denied. Nash also fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921â€“2005), a nurse whom he abandoned when informed of her pregnancy.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The movie also did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize that they renewed their relationship, although she allowed him to live with her as a boarder beginning in 1970. They remarried in 2001.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During graduate school, it appears in the movie that Nash was averse to game playing, when, in fact, according to Nasar's biography, he spent many hours playing games and even created a new game called "John" or "Nash" (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)" title="Hex (board game)">Hex</a>). Interestingly, the game was somewhat similar to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" title="Go (game)">Go</a>, but the shape of the squares became hexagons. The game, somewhat in conflict with the movie's mathematical point, was not one in which "nobody wins," but was "a zero-sum two-person game with perfect information in which one player always has a winning strategy" (p.Â 77).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. He was appointed as C.L.E. Moore Instructor at MIT. The pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. In 1947, the theory of a triple helix had not been proposed yet, yet Ainsley's tie appears to have triple helices on it; <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-stranded_DNA" title="Triple-stranded DNA">Triple-stranded DNA</a> was hypothesized during the 1950s but was not formally proposed until 1952 by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> in <i>Nature</i>. The film has Nash saying around the time of his Nobel prize in 1994: "I take the newer medications", when in fact Nash did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something Nash's biography highlights. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because it was felt as though the film was encouraging the notion that all schizophrenics can overcome their illness without medication. Nash also never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. Around the time of the Oscar nominations, Nash was accused of being <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-semitic" title="Anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a>. Nash denied this and it was speculated that the accusation was designed to affect the votes inside the Academy Awards.</p>

Roeper also stated "this is one of the very best films of the year". Mike Clark of USA Today gave three and a half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance and referred to as a welcomed follow up to Howard's previous film <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grinch_(film)" title="The Grinch (film)">The Grinch</a></i>; however, Desson Thomson of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Post" title="Washington Post">Washington Post</a> found the film to be "one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies", and Charles Taylor of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon_Magazine" title="Salon Magazine">Salon Magazine</a> gave the film a scathing review, calling Crowe's performance "the biggest load of hooey to stink up the screen this year".
