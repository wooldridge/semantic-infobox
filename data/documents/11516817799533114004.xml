      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> surprised many by choosing Saint over dozens of other candidates for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femme_fatale" title="Femme fatale">femme fatale</a> role in what was to become a suspense classic <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_by_Northwest" title="North by Northwest">North by Northwest</a></i> (1959) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Mason" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>.

The film ranks number forty on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s list of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Movies" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies">100 Greatest American Movies of All Time</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At the time of the film's production, much publicity was garnered by Hitchcock's decision to cut Saint's waist-length blonde hair for the first time in her career. Hitchcock explained at the time, "Short hair gives Eva a more exotic look, in keeping with her role of the glamorous woman of my story. I wanted her dressed like a kept woman - smart, simple, subtle and quiet. In other words, anything but the bangles and beads type." The director also worked with Saint to make her voice lower and huskier and even personally chose costumes for her during a shopping trip to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergdorf_Goodman" title="Bergdorf Goodman">Bergdorf Goodman</a> in New York City.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The change in Saint's screen persona, coupled with her adroit performance as a seductive woman of mystery who keeps Cary Grant (and the audience) off-balance, was widely heralded. In his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i> review of August 7, 1959, critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosley_Crowther" title="Bosley Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> wrote, "In casting Eva Marie Saint as [Cary Grant's] romantic vis-a-vis, Mr. Hitchcock has plumbed some talents not shown by the actress heretofore. Although she is seemingly a hard, designing type, she also emerges both the sweet heroine and a glamorous charmer." In 2000, recalling her experience making the picture with Cary Grant and Hitchcock, Saint said, "[Grant] would say, 'See, Eva Marie, you don't have to cry in a movie to have a good time. Just kick up your heels and have fun.' Hitchcock said, 'I don't want you to do a sink-to-sink movie again, ever. You've done these black-and-white movies like <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront" title="On the Waterfront">On the Waterfront</a></i>. It's drab in that tenement house. Women go to the movies, and they've just left the sink at home. They don't want to see you at the sink.' I said, 'I can't promise you that, Hitch, because I love those dramas.'"</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although <i>North by Northwest</i> might have propelled her to the top ranks of stardom, she elected to limit film work in order to spend time with her husband since 1951, director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Hayden" title="Jeffrey Hayden">Jeffrey Hayden</a>, and their two children.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This story of Mob informers was based on a number of true stories and filmed on location in and around the docks of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken" title="Hoboken">Hoboken</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>. Mob-connected union boss Johnny Friendly (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_J._Cobb" title="Lee J. Cobb">Lee J. Cobb</a>) gloats about his iron fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the Waterfront Crime Commission know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play "D and D" ("deaf and dumb"), submitting to their oppressed position rather than risk the danger and shame of informing. Terry Malloy (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlon_Brando" title="Marlon Brando">Marlon Brando</a>) is a dockworker whose brother Charley (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Steiger" title="Rod Steiger">Rod Steiger</a>) is Friendlyâ€˜s lawyer. Some years earlier, Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly had Charley instruct him to deliberately lose a fight that he could have won, so that Friendly could win money betting on the weaker opponent.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the film begins, simpleminded Terry is used to coax a popular dockworker out to an ambush, preventing him from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry resents being so used in the murder but is still willing to remain D&amp;D. Terry meets and is smitten by the murdered dockworker's sister, Edie (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Marie_Saint" title="Eva Marie Saint">Eva Marie Saint</a>), who has shamed "waterfront priest" Father Barry (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malden" title="Karl Malden">Karl Malden</a>) into fomenting action against the union/mob. Soon both Edie and Father Barry are urging Terry to testify. Another dockworker by the name of Kayo Dugan who agrees to testify after Father Barry's promise of unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>On the Waterfront</i> was based on a 24-part series of articles in the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Sun" title="New York Sun">New York Sun</a></i> by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Johnson_(journalist)" title="Malcolm Johnson (journalist)">Malcolm Johnson</a>, "Crime on the Waterfront". The series won the 1949 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize_for_Local_Reporting" title="Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting">Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting</a>. The stories detailed widespread <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">corruption, extortion and racketeering</a> on the waterfront of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To add realism, <i>On the Waterfront</i> was filmed over 36 days on-location in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoboken,_New_Jersey" title="Hoboken, New Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a> (the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, rooftops). And some of the labor boss's chief bodyguards/goons in the film (Abe Simon as Barney, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Galento" title="Tony Galento">Tony Galento</a> as Truck and Tami Mauriello as Tullio) were real-life, former professional heavyweight boxers.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In <i>On the Waterfront</i>, protagonist Terry Malloy's (Brando's) fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DiVincenzo, who testified before a real-life <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfront_Commission_of_New_York_Harbor" title="Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor">Waterfront Commission</a> on the facts of life on the Hoboken Docks and had suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DiVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DiVincenzo recounted his story to screenwriter <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a> during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetingsÂ â€” which some claim never occurredÂ â€” even though Shulberg attended Di Vincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Karl Malden's character of Father Barry was based on the real-life "waterfront priest" <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Corridan" title="John M. Corridan">Father John M. Corridan</a>, S.J., a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit" title="Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priest, graduate of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regis_High_School_(New_York_City)" title="Regis High School (New York City)">Regis High School</a> who operated a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> labor school on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Side_(Manhattan)" title="West Side (Manhattan)">west side of Manhattan</a>. Father Corridan was extensively interviewed by Budd Schulberg (who wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, <i>Waterfront Priest</i> by Allen Raymond).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"On the Waterfront" is also the only movie in which we can see the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Andrea_Doria" title="SS Andrea Doria">Andrea Doria</a>, the Italian liner that sank in 1956 after a collision in the Atlantic Ocean: in a scene, Marlon Brando watches the ship as she descends the Hudson River.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Budd Schulberg later published a novel just called <i>Waterfront</i> that was much closer to his original screenplay than the version that was released on-screen. Among several differences is that Terry Malloy is brutally murdered.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Political_context">Political context</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film is widely considered to be Kazan's answer to those that criticised him for his identifying eight (former) <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist" title="Communist">Communists</a> in the film industry before the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Un-American_Activities_Committee" title="House Un-American Activities Committee">House Committee on Un-American Activities</a> (HUAC) in 1952. Kazan's critics included his friend and collaborator, the renowned playwright <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Miller" title="Arthur Miller">Arthur Miller</a>, who had written the original screenplay (titled "The Hook") for the film that would evolve into <i>On the Waterfront</i>. Miller was replaced by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Schulberg" title="Budd Schulberg">Budd Schulberg</a>, also a witness before HUAC.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>On the Waterfront</i>, being about a heroic mob informer, showed that there could be nobility in a man who "named names". In the movie, variations of that phrase are repeatedly used by Terry Malloy. The film also repeatedly emphasizes the waterfront's code of "D and D" ("Deaf and Dumb"), remaining silent at all costs and not "ratting out" one's friends. In the end, Malloy does just that and his doing so is depicted sympathetically. Miller's response to the film's message is contained in his own play, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_View_from_the_Bridge" title="A View from the Bridge">A View from the Bridge</a></i>, which presents a contrary view of those who inform on others.</p>

On the critics' website <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, the film holds a 100% "Certified Fresh" rating, based on 48 reviews. In 1989, this film was deemed "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant" by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress" title="Library of Congress">Library of Congress</a> and selected for preservation in the United States <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Film_Registry" title="National Film Registry">National Film Registry</a>. Film critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> lauded the film, stating that Brando and Kazan changed acting in American movies for ever and then adding it to his "Great Movies" list. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a> critic <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=A.H._Weiler&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="A.H.
