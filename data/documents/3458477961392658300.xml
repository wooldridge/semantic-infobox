Although the stage cast was largely replaced with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> contract players, she was hired to reprise her role as Hermia.

In 1941, de Havilland became a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized_citizen" title="Naturalized citizen">naturalized citizen</a> of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>. She was becoming increasingly frustrated by the roles assigned to her. She felt she had proven herself capable of playing more than the demure ingÃ©nues and damsels in distress that were quickly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typecasting" title="Typecasting">typecasting</a> her, and began to reject scripts that offered her this type of role. When her Warner Bros. contract expired, the studio informed her that six months had been added to it for times she had been on suspension; the law then allowed for studios to suspend contract players for rejecting a role and the period of suspension to be added to the contract period. In theory, this allowed a studio to maintain indefinite control over an uncooperative contractee.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Most accepted this situation, while a few tried to change the system. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bette_Davis" title="Bette Davis">Bette Davis</a> had mounted an unsuccessful lawsuit against <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> in the 1930s. De Havilland mounted a lawsuit in the 1940s, supported by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild" title="Screen Actors Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> and was successful, thereby reducing the power of the studios and extending greater creative freedom to the performers. The decision was one of the most significant and far-reaching legal rulings in Hollywood. Her victory won her the respect and admiration of her peers, among them her own sister <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Fontaine" title="Joan Fontaine">Joan Fontaine</a> who later commented, "Hollywood owes Olivia a great deal". The studio, however, vowed never to hire her again. The California Court of Appeal's ruling came to be informally known, and is still known to this day, as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Law" title="De Havilland Law">De Havilland Law</a> (California Labor Code Section 2855). It imposes a 7 year limit on contracts for service unless the employee agrees to an extension beyond that term.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the release of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devotion_(film)" title="Devotion (film)">Devotion</a></i>, a Hollywood biography of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bront%C3%AB" title="BrontÃ«">BrontÃ« sisters</a> filmed in 1943 but withheld from release during the suspension and litigation, de Havilland signed a three picture deal with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. The quality and variety of her roles began to improve. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Agee" title="James Agee">James Agee</a>, in his review for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Mirror_(film)" title="The Dark Mirror (film)">The Dark Mirror</a></i> (1946), noted the change, and stated that although she had always been "one of the prettiest women in movies", her recent performances had proven her acting ability. He commented that she did not possess "any remarkable talent, but her playing is thoughtful, quiet, detailed and well-sustained ... [a]nd an undivided pleasure to see." She won Best Actress Academy Awards for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_Each_His_Own_(film)" title="To Each His Own (film)">To Each His Own</a></i> (1946) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heiress" title="The Heiress">The Heiress</a></i> (1949), and was also widely praised for her Academy Awardâ€“nominated performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Snake_Pit" title="The Snake Pit">The Snake Pit</a></i> (1948). This was one of the earliest films to attempt a realistic portrayal of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_illness" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a>, and de Havilland was lauded for her willingness to play a role that was completely devoid of glamor and that confronted such controversial subject matter. She won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Film_Critics_Circle_Awards" title="New York Film Critics Circle Awards">New York Film Critics Award</a> for both <i>The Snake Pit</i> and <i>The Heiress</i>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland appeared sporadically in films after the 1950s and attributed this partly to the growing permissiveness of Hollywood films of the period. She declined the role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanche_DuBois" title="Blanche DuBois">Blanche DuBois</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Streetcar_Named_Desire_(1951_film)" title="A Streetcar Named Desire (1951 film)">A Streetcar Named Desire</a></i>, allegedly citing the unsavory nature of some elements of the script and saying there were certain lines she could not allow herself to speak. De Havilland denied this in a 2006 interview, saying she had recently given birth to her son when offered the role, which had been a life altering experience, and was unable to relate to the material. The role went to her <i>Gone with the Wind</i> co-star, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>, who won her second <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Awards" title="Academy Awards">Academy Award</a> for her role. De Havilland continued acting on film until the late 1970s, afterward continuing her career on television until the late 1980s, highlighted by her winning a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe" title="Golden Globe">Golden Globe</a> and earning a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> nomination for her performance as the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Feodorovna_(Dagmar_of_Denmark)" title="Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)">Dowager Empress Maria</a> in the 1986 miniseries <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anastasia:_The_Mystery_of_Anna" title="Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna">Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna</a></i>.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Errol_Flynn" title="Errol Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> were known as one of Hollywood's most exciting on-screen couples, appearing in eight films together, but contrary to salacious rumours, were never linked romantically.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland stated, "He never guessed I had a crush on him. And it didn't get better either. In fact, I read in something that he wrote that he was in love with me when we made <i>The Charge of the Light Brigade</i> the next year, in 1936. I was amazed to read that, for it never occurred to me that he was smitten with me, too, even though we did all those pictures together." However, in an interview cited on Turner Classic Movies de Havilland claims she knew the crush was reciprocal and further states that Flynn proposed, though de Havilland turned down the proposal as Flynn was at the time still married to actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lili_Damita" title="Lili Damita">Lili Damita</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">De Havilland married novelist <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Goodrich" title="Marcus Goodrich">Marcus Goodrich</a> in 1946 and they <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorced</a> in 1953.

She was married to French journalist and <i>Paris Match</i> editor Pierre Galante between 1955 until 1979. Their daughter, Giselle (GisÃ¨le in French), who later became a journalist, was born in July 1956 when de Havilland was 40. After the divorce, de Havilland and Galante remained on good terms, and she nursed him through his final illness (lung cancer) in Paris, which was the stated reason for her absence from the 70th anniversary of the Oscars in 1998.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Of the two sisters, Olivia was the first to become an actress; when Joan tried to follow her lead, their mother, who allegedly favored Olivia, refused to let her use the family name. So Joan was forced to invent a name, taking first Joan Burfield, and later Joan Fontaine. Biographer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Higham_(biographer)" title="Charles Higham (biographer)">Charles Higham</a> records that the sisters have always had an uneasy relationship, starting in early childhood when Olivia would rip up the clothes Joan had to wear as hand-me-downs, forcing Joan to sew them back together. A lot of the feud and resentment between the sisters allegedly stems from Joan's perception of Olivia being their mother's favorite child.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both Olivia and Joan were nominated for an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actress" title="Academy Award for Best Actress">Academy Award for Best Actress</a> in 1942. Joan won first for her role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Hitchcock" title="Alfred Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspicion_(film)" title="Suspicion (film)">Suspicion</a></i> (1941) over Olivia's performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Back_the_Dawn" title="Hold Back the Dawn">Hold Back the Dawn</a></i>. Charles Higham states that Joan "felt guilty about winning given her lack of obsessive career drive...". Higham has described the events of the awards ceremony, stating that as Joan stepped forward to collect her award, she pointedly rejected Olivia's attempts at congratulating her and that Olivia was both offended and embarrassed by her behavior. Several years later, Olivia would remember the slight and exact her own revenge by brushing past Joan, who was waiting with her hand extended, because Olivia had allegedly taken offense at a comment Joan had made about Olivia's husband. Olivia's relationship with Joan continued to deteriorate after the two incidents. Charles Higham has stated that this was the near final straw for what would become a lifelong feud, but the sisters did not completely stop speaking to each other until 1975. According to Joan, Olivia did not invite her to a memorial service for their mother, who had recently died. Olivia claims she told Joan, but that Joan had brushed her off, claiming that she was too busy to attend.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Charles Higham records that Joan has an estranged relationship with her own daughters as well, possibly because she discovered that they were secretly maintaining a relationship with their aunt Olivia. Both sisters have refused to comment publicly about their feud and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_family" title="Dysfunctional family">dysfunctional family</a> relationships.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A resident of Paris since the 1950s, de Havilland rarely makes public appearances.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Hold Back the Dawn</i> describes the marriage of Georges Iscovescu (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Boyer" title="Charles Boyer">Boyer</a>), a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania" title="Romania">Romanian</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigolo" title="Gigolo">gigolo</a> searching for a way to enter the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_of_America" title="United States of America">United States</a>, and Miss Emmy Brown (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Haviland" title="Olivia de Haviland">de Haviland</a>), an American schoolteacher who meets Iscovescu in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexican</a> border town.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film begins at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount</a> film company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, where Iscovescu sneaks into a studio to meet with a director. In terms of chronology, this scene occurs near the end of the story. Iscovescu is fleeing immigration agents after illegally crossing the border to visit Emmy in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> hospital. Emmy is Iscovescu's wife at this point, but has suffered life-threatening injuries in a car accident after discovering that he was using her to gain access to the United States and intended to divorce her as soon as possible. However, after seeing Emmy's love and innocence during a romantic honeymoon with her in a small Mexican village, Iscovescu developed a genuine affection for her and sacrificed his own immigration status by visiting her. With his support and encouragement through the night after the accident, she recovered from a near-death condition. In the Paramount studio, Iscovescu offers to sell his and Emmy's story in order to return some money she gave him, before he is sent back to Mexico.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As Iscovescu recounts his story, the film's setting changes to a few weeks earlier, in an unnamed Mexican town on the American border where he waits in the hope of immigrating into the U.S.. He is told that he will have to wait several years, but learns from Anita Dixon (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette_Goddard" title="Paulette Goddard">Goddard</a>), who was once his professional dance partner, that he can achieve his goal by marrying an American citizen. Anita loves Georges and wishes to dance with him again in the U.S..</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After failing to find a wealthy American woman to lure into marriage on the 4th of July, Georges decides to target Emmy, who is visiting with some students in her class. His romantic overtures are successful, and they marry the next day. Emmy returns a few days later, but immigration inspector Hammock (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Abel" title="Walter Abel">Abel</a>) appears, hunting for con artists such as Georges. In order to evade Hammock, Georges drives Emmy to a small village, where they participate in romantic traditional rituals for newlyweds. Georges becomes increasingly bothered by his conscience as he sees how happy and unsuspecting Emmy is.</p>
