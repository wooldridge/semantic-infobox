He grew up, according to his daughter, with "a very serious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney_accent" title="Cockney accent">cockney accent</a> and a speech impediment". His father was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_people" title="British people">British</a> stage actor Frederick Rains, and the young Rains made his stage debut at 11 in <i>Nell of Old Drury</i>.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">His acting talents were recognised by Sir <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Beerbohm_Tree" title="Herbert Beerbohm Tree">Herbert Beerbohm Tree</a>, founder of The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Dramatic_Art" title="Royal Academy of Dramatic Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a>.

Later, Rains taught at the institution, teaching <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gielgud" title="John Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, among others.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rains served in the First World War in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Scottish_Regiment" title="London Scottish Regiment">London Scottish Regiment</a>, with fellow actors <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Rathbone" title="Basil Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Colman" title="Ronald Colman">Ronald Colman</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marshall" title="Herbert Marshall">Herbert Marshall</a>. Rains was involved in a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">gas attack</a> that left him nearly blind in one eye for the rest of his life. However, the war did aid his social advancement and, by its end, he had risen from the rank of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)" title="Private (rank)">Private</a> to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(OF-2)" title="Captain (OF-2)">Captain</a>.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rains began his career in the London theatre, having a success in the title role of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Drinkwater_(playwright)" title="John Drinkwater (playwright)">John Drinkwater</a>'s play <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_S._Grant" title="Ulysses S.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rains came relatively late to film acting and his first screen test was a failure, but his distinctive voice won him the title role in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Whale" title="James Whale">James Whale</a>'s <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Man_(film)" title="The Invisible Man (film)">The Invisible Man</a></i> (1933) when someone accidentally overheard his screen test being played in the next room. Rains later credited director <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Curtiz" title="Michael Curtiz">Michael Curtiz</a> with teaching him the more understated requirements of film acting, or "what not to do in front of a camera".</p>

This 1957 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a> color special, shown as a film rather than a live or videotaped program, was highly successful with the public.

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rains remained a popular character actor in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing in many films.

	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The governor of an unnamed western state, Hubert "Happy" Hopper (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kibbee" title="Guy Kibbee">Guy Kibbee</a>), has to pick a replacement for recently deceased <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senator</a> Sam Foley. His <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption" title="Political corruption">corrupt</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_boss" title="Political boss">political boss</a>, Jim Taylor (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Arnold_(actor)" title="Edward Arnold (actor)">Edward Arnold</a>), pressures Hopper to choose his handpicked stooge, while popular committees want a reformer. The governor's children want him to select Jefferson Smith (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Stewart_(actor)" title="James Stewart (actor)">James Stewart</a>), the head of the Boy Rangers. Unable to make up his mind between Taylor's stooge and the reformer, Hopper decides to flip a coin. When it lands on edge â€“ and next to a newspaper story on one of Smith's accomplishments â€“ he chooses Smith, calculating that his wholesome image will please the people while his naÃ¯vetÃ© will make him easy to manipulate.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Smith is taken under the wing of the publicly esteemed, but secretly crooked, Senator Joseph Paine (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Rains" title="Claude Rains">Claude Rains</a>), who was Smith's late father's oldest and best friend, and he develops an immediate attraction to the senator's daughter, Susan (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrid_Allwyn" title="Astrid Allwyn">Astrid Allwyn</a>). The unforgiving Washington press quickly labels Smith a bumpkin, with no business being a senator. Paine, to keep Smith busy, suggests he propose a bill.</p>
      </wiki:abstract>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, Smith's chief of staff, Clarissa Saunders (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>), has come to believe in him, and talks him into launching a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster" title="Filibuster">filibuster</a> to postpone the Works bill and prove his innocence on the Senate floor just before the vote to expel him. While Smith talks non-stop, his constituents try to rally around him, but the entrenched opposition is too powerful, and all attempts are crushed. Due to influence of the Taylor "machine", on his orders, newspapers and radio stations in Smith's home state refuse to report what Smith has to say and even twist the facts against the Senator. An effort by the Boy Rangers to spread the news results in vicious attacks on the children by Taylor's minions.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although all hope seems lost, the senators begin to pay attention as Smith approaches utter exhaustion. Paine has one last card up his sleeve: he brings in bins of letters and telegrams from Smith's home state from people demanding his expulsion. Nearly broken by the news, Smith finds a small ray of hope in a friendly smile from the President of the Senate (<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Carey_(actor_born_1878)" title="Harry Carey (actor born 1878)">Harry Carey</a>). Smith vows to press on until people believe him, but immediately collapses in a faint. Overcome with guilt, Paine leaves the Senate chamber and attempts to kill himself with a gun. When he is stopped, he bursts back into the Senate chamber, loudly confesses to the whole scheme, and affirms Smith's innocence. Order in the chamber completely breaks down as cheering people rush onto the Senate floor and Smith's supporters hug each other. The President of the Senate calls for order a few times but eventually gives up, sitting back in his chair.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> originally purchased <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_R._Foster" title="Lewis R. Foster">Lewis R. Foster</a>'s unpublished story, variously called <i>The Gentleman from Montana</i> and <i>The Gentleman from Wyoming</i>, as a vehicle for <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bellamy" title="Ralph Bellamy">Ralph Bellamy</a>, but once <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> came onboard as directorÂ â€“ after <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouben_Mamoulian" title="Rouben Mamoulian">Rouben Mamoulian</a> had expressed interestÂ â€“ the film was to be a sequel to his <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Deeds_Goes_to_Town" title="Mr. Deeds Goes to Town">Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</a></i>, called <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Washington</i>, with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> reprising his role as Longfellow Deeds. Because Cooper was unavailable, Capra then "saw it immediately as a vehicle for Jimmy Stewart and Jean Arthur," and Stewart was borrowed from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>. Capra said of Stewart: ""I knew he would make a hell of a Mr. Smith... He looked like the country kid, the idealist. It was very close to him."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although a youth group is featured in the story, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts of America</a> refused to allow their name to be used in the film and instead the fanciful "Boy Rangers" was used.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In January 1938, both <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> had submitted Foster's story to the censors at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Office" title="Hays Office">Hays Office</a>, probably indicating that both studios had interest in the project before Columbia purchased it. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Breen" title="Joseph Breen">Joseph Breen</a>, the head of that office, warned the studios:</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was in production from April 3, 1939 to July 7 of that year. Some location shooting took place in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_DC" title="Washington, DC">Washington, DC</a>, at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Station_(Washington)" title="Union Station (Washington)">Union Station</a> and at the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol" title="United States Capitol">United States Capitol</a>, as well as other locations for background use.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the studio, to ensure authenticity, an elaborate set was created, consisting of Senate committee rooms, cloak rooms, hotel suites as well as specific Washington, DC monuments, all based on a trip Capra and his crew made to the capital. Even the Press Club of Washington was reproduced in minute detail, but the major effort went into a faithful reproduction of the Senate Chamber on the Columbia lot. James D. Preston, a former superintendent of the Senate gallery, acted as technical director for the Senate set, as well as advising on political protocol. The production also utilized the "New York street set" on the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> lot, using a thousand extras when that scene was shot.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ending of the film was apparently changed at some point, as the original program describes Stewart and Arthur returning to Mr. Smith's hometown, where they are met by a big parade, with the implication that they are married and starting a family. In addition, the Taylor political machine was shown being crushed, Stewart visited Claude Rains, on a motorcycle, and forgiving him, and a visit to Smith's mother. Some of this footage can be seen in the film's trailer.</p>
      <h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Impact">Impact</span></h2>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When it was first releasedÂ â€“ the film premiered in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Hall" title="Constitution Hall">Constitution Hall</a> in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, on October 17, 1939, sponsored by the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club_(USA)" title="National Press Club (USA)">National Press Club</a>, an event to which 4000 guests were invited, including 45 senatorsÂ â€“ <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> was attacked by the Washington press, and politicians in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Congress" title="U.S. Congress">U.S. Congress</a>, as <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Americanism" title="Anti-Americanism">anti-American</a> and pro-<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communist</a> for its portrayal of corruption in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">American government</a>. While Capra claims in his autobiography that some senators walked out of the premiere, contemporary press accounts are unclear about whether this occurred or not, or whether senators yelled back at the screen during the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It <i>is</i> known that <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alben_W._Barkley" title="Alben W. Barkley">Alben W. Barkley</a>, the Senate Majority Leader, called the film "silly and stupid," and said it "makes the Senate look like a bunch of crooks." He also remarked that the film was "a grotesque distortion" of the Senate, "as grotesque as anything ever seen! Imagine the Vice President of the United States winking at a pretty girl in the gallery in order to encourage a filibuster!" Barkley thought the film "...showed the Senate as the biggest aggregation of nincompoops on record!"</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Pete Harrison, a respected journalist, suggested that the Senate pass a bill allowing theatre owners to refuse to show films that "were not in the best interest of our country." That did not happen, but one of the ways that some senators attempted to retaliate for the damage they felt the film had done to the reputation of their institution was by pushing the passage of the Neely Anti-Block Booking Bill, which eventually led to the breakup of the studio-owned theater chains in the late 1940s. Columbia responded by distributing a program which put forward the film's patriotism and support of democracy, and publicized the film's many positive reviews.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Other objections were voiced as well. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_P._Kennedy" title="Joseph P. Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy</a>, the American Ambassador to Great Britain, wrote to Capra and Columbia head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> to say that he feared the film would damage "America's prestige in Europe", and because of this urged that it be withdrawn from European release. Capra and Cohn responded citing the film's review, which mollified Kennedy to the extent that he never followed up, although he privately still had doubts about the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The film was banned in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">Fascist</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Russia" title="Soviet Russia">Soviet Russia</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falangist" title="Falangist">Falangist</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> According to Capra, the film was also <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubbing_(filmmaking)" title="Dubbing (filmmaking)">dubbed</a> in certain European countries to alter the message of the film so it conformed with official ideology.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When a ban on American films was imposed in German-occupied <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France" title="France">France</a> in 1942, some theaters chose to show <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> as the last movie before the ban went into effect. One theater owner in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> reportedly screened the film nonstop for 30 days after the ban was announced.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The critical response to the film was more measured than the reaction by politicians, domestic and foreign. The critic for the <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times" title="New York Times">New York Times</a></i>, for instance, Frank S. Nugent, wrote that</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i> has been called one of the quintessential <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower" title="Whistleblower">whistleblower</a> films in American history. Dr. James Murtagh and Dr. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Wigand" title="Jeffrey Wigand">Jeffrey Wigand</a> cited this film as a seminal event in U.S. history at the first "<a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower_Week_in_Washington" title="Whistleblower Week in Washington">Whistleblower Week in Washington</a>" (May 13â€“19, 2007).</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Nevertheless, Smith's filibuster and the tacit encouragement of the Senate President are both emblematic of the director's belief in the difference that one individual can make. This theme would be expanded further in Capra's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_a_Wonderful_Life" title="It's a Wonderful Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a></i> and other films.</p>
