      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frank Capra had read the James Hilton novel while filming <i>It Happened One Night</i>, and he intended to make <i>Lost Horizon</i> his next project. When <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Colman" title="Ronald Colman">Ronald Colman</a>, his first and only choice for the role of Robert Conway, proved to be unavailable, Capra decided to wait and made <i>Mr. Deeds Goes to Town</i> instead.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Harry Cohn authorized a budget of $1.25 million for the film, the largest amount ever allocated to a project up to that time. According to a 1986 <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)" title="Variety (magazine)">Variety</a></i> interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra,_Jr." title="Frank Capra, Jr.">Frank Capra, Jr.</a>, his father had wanted to shoot the film in color, but because the only suitable <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_footage" title="Stock footage">stock footage</a>, such as scenes from a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_(film)" title="Documentary (film)">documentary</a> about the Himalayas, he intended to incorporate into the film was in black and white, he was forced to change his plans. In 1985, Capra, Sr. claimed the decision to film in black and white was made because <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_motion_picture_film" title="Color motion picture film">three-strip color</a> was new and fairly expensive, and the studio was unwilling to increase the film's budget so he could utilize it.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From the beginning, Capra ran into difficulties that resulted in serious <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun" title="Cost overrun">cost overruns</a>. Principal photography began on March 23, 1936, and by the time it was completed on July 17, the director had spent $1.6 million.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Contributing to the added expenses was the filming of snow scenes and airplane interiors at the Los Angeles Ice and Cold Storage Warehouse, where the low temperature affected the equipment and caused lengthy delays. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streamline_Moderne" title="Streamline Moderne">Streamline Moderne</a> sets representing Shangri-La, designed by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Goosson" title="Stephen Goosson">Stephen Goosson</a>, had been constructed adjacent to Hollywood Way, a busy thoroughfare by day, which necessitated filming at night and heavily added to overtime expenses. Many exteriors were filmed on location in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs" title="Palm Springs">Palm Springs</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucerne_Valley,_California" title="Lucerne Valley, California">Lucerne Valley</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojai,_California" title="Ojai, California">Ojai Valley</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojave_Desert" title="Mojave Desert">Mojave Desert</a>, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Nevada_(U.S.)" title="Sierra Nevada (U.S.)">Sierra Nevada Mountains</a>, and in what is now <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westlake_Village,_California" title="Westlake Village, California">Westlake Village</a>, adding the cost of transporting cast, crew, and equipment to the swelling budget.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Capra also used multiple cameras to cover every scene from several angles, and by the time shooting ended, he had used 1.1 million feet of film. For one scene lasting four minutes, he shot 6,000 feet, the equivalent of one hour of screen time. He spent six days filming <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Jaffe_(actor)" title="Sam Jaffe (actor)">Sam Jaffe</a> performing the High Lama's monologues, then reshot the scenes twice, once with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Connolly" title="Walter Connolly">Walter Connolly</a> because it was felt Jaffe's makeup was unconvincing and he looked too young for the role. A total of forty minutes of footage featuring the High Lama eventually was trimmed to the twelve that appeared in the final cut.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming took one hundred days, thirty-four more than scheduled. The film's final cost, including prints and promotional advertising, was $2,626,620, and it remained in the red until it was reissued in 1942.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first cut of the film was six hours long. The studio considered releasing it in two parts, but eventually decided the idea was impractical. Working with editors Gene Havlick and Gene Milford, Capra managed to trim the running time to 3Â½ hours for the first preview in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara</a> on November 22, 1936. Following a showing of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwball_comedy" title="Screwball comedy">screwball comedy</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodora_Goes_Wild" title="Theodora Goes Wild">Theodora Goes Wild</a></i>, the audience was not receptive to a drama of epic length. Many walked out, and those who remained laughed at sequences intended to be serious. The feedback was mostly negative, and Capra was so distraught he fled to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Arrowhead" title="Lake Arrowhead">Lake Arrowhead</a> and remained in seclusion there for several days. He later claimed he burned the first two reels of the film, an account disputed by Milford, who noted setting the nitrate film on fire would have created a devastating explosion.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the disastrous preview, Capra made extensive cuts and, on January 12, 1937, reshot scenes involving the High Lama written by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Buchman" title="Sidney Buchman">Sidney Buchman</a>, who declined screen credit for his work, which placed more emphasis on the growing desperation of the world situation at the time. Still unhappy with the film's length, Harry Cohn intervened; he cancelled the February 1 opening and edited the film himself. When it premiered in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> on March 2, it was 132 minutes long. During the film's initial release in selected cities, it was a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roadshow_theatrical_release" title="Roadshow theatrical release">roadshow attraction</a>, with only two presentations per day and tickets sold on a reserved-seat basis. Because the box office returns were so low, the studio head deleted an additional fourteen minutes before the film went into general release the following September. Due primarily to the cuts made without his approval, Capra later filed a lawsuit against Columbia, citing "contractural disagreements," among them the studio's refusal to pay him a $100,000 semi-annual salary payment due him. A settlement was reached on November 27, 1937, with Capra collecting his money and being relieved of the obligation of making one of the five films required by his contract. In 1985, the director claimed Cohn, whom he described as the "Jewish producer," trimmed the film simply so theaters could have more daily showings and increase the film's chance of turning a profit.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1942, the film was re-released as <i>Lost Horizon of Shangri-La</i>.

Capra felt the film made no sense without the scene, and in later years film critic Leslie Halliwell described the missing twelve minutes as "vital."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1952, a 92-minute version of the film was released. It aimed to downplay the supposedly <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist" title="Communist">Communist</a> themes associated with utopia, as well as to limit the sympathy shown towards the Chinese, whose relationship with the American government grew strained in the years following World War II.</p>

Although all 132 minutes of the original soundtrack were recovered, only 125 minutes of film could be found, so the seven minutes of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_film" title="Lost film">missing film footage</a> were replaced with a combination of publicity photos of the actors in costume taken during filming and still frames depicting the missing scenes.</p>
