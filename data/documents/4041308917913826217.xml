	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><b>William Clark Gable</b> (February 1, 1901 â€“ November 16, 1960) was an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States" title="Cinema of the United States">American film actor</a>, nicknamed "The King of Hollywood" in his heyday. In 1999, the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Film_Institute" title="American Film Institute">American Film Institute</a> named Gable seventh among the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFI%27s_100_Years..._100_Stars" title="AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars">greatest male stars of all time</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable's most famous role was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> in the 1939 <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_film" title="Epic film">epic film</a> <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i>, in which he starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivien_Leigh" title="Vivien Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a>. His performance earned him his third nomination for the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a>; he won for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a></i> (1934) and was also nominated for <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty_(1935_film)" title="Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)">Mutiny on the Bounty</a></i> (1935). Later performances were in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_Silent,_Run_Deep" title="Run Silent, Run Deep">Run Silent, Run Deep</a></i>, a submarine war film, and his final film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misfits_(film)" title="The Misfits (film)">The Misfits</a></i> (1961), which paired Gable with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe" title="Marilyn Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> in her last screen appearance.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">During his long film career, Gable appeared opposite some of the most popular actresses of the time. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a>, who was his favorite actress to work with, was partnered with Gable in eight films, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a> was with him seven times, and he was paired with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Harlow" title="Jean Harlow">Jean Harlow</a> in six productions. He also starred with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a> in four features, and with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a> in three. Gable was often named the top male star in the mid-30s, and was second only to the top box-office draw of all, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple" title="Shirley Temple">Shirley Temple</a>.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_life">Early life</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was born in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadiz,_Ohio" title="Cadiz, Ohio">Cadiz</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> to William Henry "Bill" Gable, an oil-well driller, and Adeline (nÃ©e Hershelman), who was of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germans" title="Germans">German</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_people" title="Irish people">Irish</a> descent. He was mistakenly listed as a female on his birth certificate. His original last name was Goebel, but this was considered too German during World War I because of anti German sentiment. Birth registrations, school records and other documents contradict one another. "William" would have been in honor of his father. "Clark" was the maiden name of his maternal grandmother. In childhood he was almost always called "Clark"; some friends called him "Clarkie," "Billy," or "Gabe".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">When he was six months old, his sickly mother had him baptized <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>. She died when he was ten months old, probably of an aggressive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_tumor" title="Brain tumor">brain tumor</a>. Following her death, Gable's father's family refused to raise him as a Catholic, provoking enmity with his mother's side of the family. The dispute was resolved when his father's family agreed to allow Gable to spend time with his mother's Catholic brother, Charles Hershelman, and his wife on their farm in Vernon, Pennsylvania.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In April 1903, Gable's father Will married Jennie Dunlap, whose family came from the small neighboring town of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopedale,_Ohio" title="Hopedale, Ohio">Hopedale</a>. Gable was a tall shy child with a loud voice. After his father purchased some land and built a house, the new family settled in. Jennie played the piano and gave her stepson lessons at home; later he took up brass instruments. She raised Gable to be well-dressed and well-groomed; he stood out from the other kids. Gable was very mechanically inclined and loved to strip down and repair cars with his father. At thirteen, he was the only boy in the men's town band. Even though his father insisted on Gable doing "manly" things, like hunting and hard physical work, Gable loved language. Among trusted company, he would recite Shakespeare, particularly the sonnets. Will Gable did agree to buy a seventy-two volume set of <i>The World's Greatest Literature</i> to improve his son's education, but claimed he never saw his son use it. In 1917, when Gable was in high school, his father had financial difficulties. Will decided to settle his debts and try his hand at farming and the family moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenna,_Ohio" title="Ravenna, Ohio">Ravenna</a>, just outside of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akron,_Ohio" title="Akron, Ohio">Akron</a>. Gable had trouble settling down in the area. Despite his father's insistence that he work the farm, Gable soon left to work in Akron's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.F._Goodrich" title="B.F. Goodrich">B.F. Goodrich</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tire" title="Tire">tire</a> factory.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">At seventeen, Gable was inspired to be an actor after seeing the play <i>The Bird of Paradise</i>, but he was not able to make a real start until he turned 21 and inherited money. By then, his stepmother Jennie had died and his father moved to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa" title="Tulsa">Tulsa</a> to go back to the oil business. He toured in stock companies and worked the oil fields and as a horse manager. Gable found work with several second-class theater companies and worked his way across the Midwest to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon" title="Oregon">Oregon</a>, where he found work as a necktie salesman in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meier_%26_Frank" title="Meier &amp; Frank">Meier &amp; Frank</a> department store. While there, he met actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Hope_Crews" title="Laura Hope Crews">Laura Hope Crews</a>, who encouraged him to go back to the stage and into another theater company. His acting coach was a theater manager in Portland, Oregon, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Dillon" title="Josephine Dillon">Josephine Dillon</a> (seventeen years his senior). Dillon paid to have his teeth repaired and his hair styled. She guided him in building up his chronically undernourished body, and taught him better body control and posture. She spent considerable time training his naturally high-pitched voice, which Gable slowly managed to lower, and he gained better resonance and tone. As his speech habits improved, Gable's facial expressions became more natural and convincing. After the long period of rigorous training, she eventually considered him ready to attempt a film career.</p>
	<h2 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"> <span class="mw-headline" id="Career">Career</span></h2>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1924, with Dillon's financial aid, the two went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood" title="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, where she became his manager and first wife. He changed his stage name from W. C. Gable to Clark Gable. He found work as an extra in such <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film" title="Silent film">silent films</a> as Erich von Stroheim's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Merry_Widow" title="The Merry Widow">The Merry Widow</a></i> (1925), <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plastic_Age_(film)" title="The Plastic Age (film)">The Plastic Age</a></i> (1925), which starred <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clara_Bow" title="Clara Bow">Clara Bow</a>, and <i>Forbidden Paradise</i>, plus a series of two-reel comedies called <i>The Pacemakers</i>. He also appeared as a bit player in a series of shorts. However, Gable was not offered any major roles and so he returned to the stage, becoming lifelong friends with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>, who in spite of his bawling Gable out for amateurish acting at first, urged Gable to pursue a career on stage. During the 1927-28 theater season, Gable acted with the Laskin Brothers Stock Company in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, where he played many roles, gained considerable experience and became a local matinee idol. Gable then moved to New York and Dillon sought work for him on <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a>. He received good reviews in <i>Machinal</i>; "He's young, vigorous and brutally masculine," said the <i>Morning Telegraph</i>. The start of the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a> and the beginning of talking pictures caused a cancellation of many plays in the 1929-30 season and acting work became harder to get.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1930, after his impressive appearance as the seething and desperate character Killer Mears in the Los Angeles stage production of <i>The Last Mile</i>, Gable was offered a contract with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>. His first role in a sound picture was as the villain in a low-budget <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Boyd_(actor)" title="William Boyd (actor)">William Boyd</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_(genre)" title="Western (genre)">western</a> called <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Painted_Desert" title="The Painted Desert">The Painted Desert</a></i> (1931). He received a lot of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_mail" title="Fan mail">fan mail</a> as a result of his powerful voice and appearance; the studio took notice.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1930, Gable and Josephine Dillon were divorced. A few days later, he married <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a> socialite Ria Franklin Prentiss Lucas Langham. After moving to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, they were married again in 1931, possibly due to differences in state legal requirements.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">"His ears are too big and he looks like an ape," said <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> executive <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darryl_F._Zanuck" title="Darryl F.

Zanuck</a> about Clark Gable after testing him for the lead in Warner's gangster drama <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesar_(film)" title="Little Caesar (film)">Little Caesar</a></i> (1931). After several failed screen tests for Barrymore and Zanuck, Gable was signed in 1930 by MGM's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Thalberg" title="Irving Thalberg">Irving Thalberg</a>. He became a client of well-connected agent Minna Wallis, sister of producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hal_Wallis" title="Hal Wallis">Hal Wallis</a> and very close friend of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norma_Shearer" title="Norma Shearer">Norma Shearer</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable's timing in arriving in Hollywood was excellent as MGM was looking to expand its stable of male stars and he fit the bill. Gable then worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain. MGM's publicity manager Howard Strickland developed Gable's studio image, playing up his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona. To bolster his rocketing popularity, MGM frequently paired him with well-established female stars. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> asked for him as her co-star in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance,_Fools,_Dance" title="Dance, Fools, Dance">Dance, Fools, Dance</a></i> (1931). He built his fame and public visibility in such movies as <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Free_Soul" title="A Free Soul">A Free Soul</a></i> (1931), in which he played a gangster who slapped the character played by Norma Shearer (Gable never played a supporting role again after that slap). <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter" title="The Hollywood Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a></i> wrote "A star in the making has been made, one that, to our reckoning, will outdraw every other star... Never have we seen audiences work themselves into such enthusiasm as when Clark Gable walks on the screen". He followed that with <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Lenox_(Her_Fall_and_Rise)" title="Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)">Susan Lenox (Her Fall and Rise)</a></i> (1931) with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greta_Garbo" title="Greta Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>, and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessed_(1931_film)" title="Possessed (1931 film)">Possessed</a></i> (1931), in which he and Joan Crawford (then married to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Fairbanks,_Jr." title="Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.</a>) steamed up the screen with some of the passion they shared for decades to come in real life. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adela_Rogers_St._John" title="Adela Rogers St. John">Adela Rogers St. John</a> later dubbed the relationship as "the affair that nearly burned Hollywood down." <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> threatened to terminate both their contracts and for a while they kept apart and Gable shifted his attentions to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Davies" title="Marion Davies">Marion Davies</a>. On the other hand, Gable and Garbo disliked each other. She thought he was a wooden actor while he considered her a snob.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was considered for the role of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarzan" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a></i> but lost out to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Weissmuller" title="Johnny Weissmuller">Johnny Weissmuller</a>'s better physique and superior swimming prowess. However Gable's unshaven lovemaking with bra-less Jean Harlow in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dust" title="Red Dust">Red Dust</a></i> (1932) soon made him MGM's most important star. After the hit <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_Your_Man" title="Hold Your Man">Hold Your Man</a></i> (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Seas_(1935_film)" title="China Seas (1935 film)">China Seas</a></i> (1935) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_vs._Secretary" title="Wife vs. Secretary">Wife vs. Secretary</a></i> (1936). An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Harlow" title="Jean Harlow">Jean Harlow</a> made six films together, the most notable being <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dust" title="Red Dust">Red Dust</a></i> (1932) and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_(1937_film)" title="Saratoga (1937 film)">Saratoga</a></i> (1937). Harlow died of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure" title="Kidney failure">kidney failure</a> during production of <i>Saratoga</i>. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or doubles; Gable would say that he felt as if he were "in the arms of a ghost".</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to legend, Gable was lent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, then considered a second-rate operation, as punishment for refusing roles; however, this has been refuted by more recent biographies. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM" title="MGM">MGM</a> did not have a project ready for Gable and was paying him $2000 per week, under his contract, to do nothing. Studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> lent him to Columbia for $2500 per week, making a $500 per week profit.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was not the first choice to play the lead role of Peter Warne in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Happened_One_Night" title="It Happened One Night">It Happened One Night</a></i>. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a> was originally offered the role, but he felt that the script was poor. Filming began in a tense atmosphere, but both Gable and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Capra" title="Frank Capra">Frank Capra</a> enjoyed making the movie.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A persistent legend has it that Gable had a profound effect on men's fashion, thanks to a scene in this movie. As he is preparing for bed, he takes off his shirt to reveal that he is bare-chested. Sales of men's undershirts across the country allegedly declined noticeably for a period following this movie.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable won the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Actor" title="Academy Award for Best Actor">Academy Award for Best Actor</a> for his 1934 performance in the film. He returned to MGM a bigger star than ever.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The unpublished memoirs of animator <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friz_Freleng" title="Friz Freleng">Friz Freleng</a> mention that this was one of his favorite films. It has been claimed that it helped inspire the cartoon character <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugs_Bunny" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a>. Four things in the film may have coalesced to create Bugs: the personality of a minor character, Oscar Shapely and his penchant for referring to Gable's character as "Doc", an imaginary character named "Bugs Dooley" that Gable's character uses to frighten Shapely, and most of all, a scene in which Clark Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, as Bugs does.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable also earned an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a> nomination when he portrayed <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher_Christian" title="Fletcher Christian">Fletcher Christian</a> in 1935's <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutiny_on_the_Bounty_(1935_film)" title="Mutiny on the Bounty (1935 film)">Mutiny on the Bounty</a></i>.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the following years, he acted in a succession of enormously popular pictures, earning him the undisputed title of "<b>King of Hollywood</b>" in 1938. The title 'King' was first offered by <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, probably in jest but soon <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sullivan" title="Ed Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a> started a poll in his newspaper column and more than 20 million fans voted Gable 'King' and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a> 'Queen' of Hollywood. Though the honorific certainly helped his career, Gable grew tired of it and later stated, "This 'King' stuff is pure bullshit...I'm just a lucky slob from Ohio. I happened to be in the right place at the right time". Throughout most of the 1930s and the early 1940s, he was arguably the world's biggest movie star.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Despite his reluctance to play the role, Gable is best known for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gone_with_the_Wind_(film)" title="Gone with the Wind (film)">Gone with the Wind</a></i> (1939), which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. Carole Lombard may have been the first to suggest that he play <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a> (and she play Scarlett) when she bought him a copy of the bestseller, which he refused to read.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was an almost immediate favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O._Selznick" title="David O. Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>. But since Selznick had no male stars under long-term contracts, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> was Selznick's first choice. When Cooper turned down the role of Butler, he was quoted as saying, "<i>Gone With the Wind</i> is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. Iâ€™m glad itâ€™ll be Clark Gable whoâ€™s falling flat on his nose, not me." By then, Selznick had become determined to hire Gable, and set about finding a way to borrow him from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing an audience that had decided that no one else could play the part. He later conceded, "I think I know now how a fly must react after being caught in a spider's web." <i>Gone with the Wind</i> was Gable's first film that was shot in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technicolor" title="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>. Also appearing in <i>Gone With The Wind</i> in the role of "Aunt Pittypat" was <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Hope_Crews" title="Laura Hope Crews">Laura Hope Crews</a>, the friend in Portland who had coaxed Gable back into the theater.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was also reportedly friends with the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American" title="African-American">African-American</a> actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattie_McDaniel" title="Hattie McDaniel">Hattie McDaniel</a>, and he even slipped her a real alcoholic drink during the scene they were supposed to be celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable did not want to shed tears for the scene after Scarlett (Leigh) has a miscarriage. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_de_Havilland" title="Olivia de Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> made him cry, later commenting, "... Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level.

Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it."</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Decades later, Gable said that whenever his career would start to fade, a re-release of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> would soon revive his popularity, and he continued as a top leading actor for the rest of his life.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable's marriage in 1939 to his third wife, the successful American actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Lombard" title="Carole Lombard">Carole Lombard</a>, was the happiest period of his personal life. As an independent actress, her annual income exceeded his studio salary until <i>Gone with the Wind</i> brought them to rough parity. From their marriage, she gained personal stability that she had lacked, and he thrived being around her with her youthful, charming, and frank personality. Lombard liked to go hunting and fishing with Gable and with his associates, and he became more sociable around her. Most times, she tolerated his philandering ways. He one or more times stated, "You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't even know how to think about letting you down." The Gables purchased a ranch at <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encino,_California" title="Encino, California">Encino, California</a>, and once Gable had become accustomed to Lombard's often blunt way of expressing herself, they found that they had much in common, despite Gable being a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States" title="Conservatism in the United States">Conservative</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="Republican Party (United States)">Republican</a> and Lombard a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States" title="Modern liberalism in the United States">Liberal</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a>.

Lombard was declared to be the first war-related American female casualty of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, and Gable received a personal condolence note from <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable returned to his and Lombard's empty house, and a month later, he returned to the studio to work with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lana_Turner" title="Lana Turner">Lana Turner</a> in the movie, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somewhere_I%27ll_Find_You" title="Somewhere I'll Find You">Somewhere I'll Find You</a></i>. Gable was devastated by the tragic death of his wife for many months afterwards, and he began to drink heavily. However, he carried out his performances professionally on the movie sets. Gable was seen to break down for the first time in public when Lombard's funeral request note was given to him. For a while, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Crawford" title="Joan Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> returned to his side to offer her support and friendship.</p>

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1942, following Lombard's death, Gable joined the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Corps" title="United States Army Air Corps">U.S. Army Air Corps</a>. Before her death, Lombard had suggested that Gable enlist as part of the war effort, but MGM was obviously reluctant to let him go, and until her death he resisted the suggestion.

Gable had earlier expressed an interest in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_candidate_school" title="Officer candidate school">officer candidate school</a> (OCS), but he enlisted on August 12, 1942, with the intention of becoming an enlisted gunner on an air crew. MGM arranged for his studio friend, cinematographer Andrew McIntyre, to enlist with and accompany him through training.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">However, shortly after his enlistment, he and McIntyre were sent to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Beach,_Florida" title="Miami Beach, Florida">Miami Beach, Florida</a>, where they entered USAAF OCS Class 42-E on August 17, 1942.

His class of 2,600 fellow students (of which he ranked 700th in class standing) selected Gable as their graduation speaker, at which General Arnold presented them their commissions.

In the raid on Germany, one crewman was killed and two others were wounded, and flak went through Gable's boot and narrowly missed his head. When word of this reached MGM, studio executives began to badger the U.S. Army Air Corps to reassign their valuable screen property to non-combat duty. In November 1943, he returned to the United States to edit the film, only to find that the personnel shortage of aerial gunners had already been rectified.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Immediately after his discharge from the service, Gable returned to his ranch and rested. He resumed a pre-war relationship with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Grey" title="Virginia Grey">Virginia Grey</a> and dated other starlets. He introduced his golf caddie <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Wagner" title="Robert Wagner">Robert Wagner</a> to MGM casting.

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After Joan Crawford's third divorce, she and Gable resumed their affair and lived together for a brief time. Gable was acclaimed for his performance in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hucksters" title="The Hucksters">The Hucksters</a></i> (1947), a satire of post-war Madison Avenue corruption and immorality. A very public and brief romance with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulette_Goddard" title="Paulette Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a> occurred after that.

Gable's on-location affair with Grace Kelly sputtered out after filming was completed.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable became increasingly unhappy with what he considered mediocre roles offered him by MGM, while the studio regarded his salary as excessive. Studio head <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> was fired in 1951 amid slumping Hollywood production and revenue, due primarily to the rising popularity of television. Studio chiefs struggled to cut costs. Many MGM stars were fired or not renewed, including Greer Garson and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>. In 1953, Gable refused to renew his contract, and began to work independently. His first two films were <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_of_Fortune_(film)" title="Soldier of Fortune (film)">Soldier of Fortune</a></i> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tall_Men_(film)" title="The Tall Men (film)">The Tall Men</a></i>, both profitable though only modest successes. In 1955, Gable married his fifth wife, Kay Spreckels (nÃ©e Kathleen Williams), a thrice-married former fashion <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_(person)" title="Model (person)">model</a> and actress who had previously been married to sugar-refining heir Adolph B.

He found producing and acting to be too taxing on his health, and he was beginning to manifest a noticeable tremor particularly in long takes. His next project was <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Angels" title="Band of Angels">Band of Angels</a></i>, with relative newcomer <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidney_Poitier" title="Sidney Poitier">Sidney Poitier</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yvonne_De_Carlo" title="Yvonne De Carlo">Yvonne De Carlo</a>; it was a total disaster. <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek" title="Newsweek">Newsweek</a></i> said, "Here is a movie so bad that it must be seen to be disbelieved." Next he paired with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doris_Day" title="Doris Day">Doris Day</a> in <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teacher%27s_Pet_(1958_film)" title="Teacher's Pet (1958 film)">Teacher's Pet</a></i>, shot in black and white to better hide his aging face and overweight body.

Gable started to receive television offers but rejected them outright, even though some of his peers, like his old flame <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young" title="Loretta Young">Loretta Young</a>, were flourishing in the new medium. At 57, Gable finally acknowledged, "Now it's time I acted my age". His next two films were light comedies for Paramount: <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/But_Not_for_Me_(film)" title="But Not for Me (film)">But Not for Me</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a> and <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Started_in_Naples" title="It Started in Naples">It Started in Naples</a></i> with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Loren" title="Sophia Loren">Sophia Loren</a> (his last film in color).

	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable was politically conservative, though he never publicly spoke about politics. His third wife <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carole_Lombard" title="Carole Lombard">Carole Lombard</a> was an activist liberal Democrat, and she cajoled him into supporting Democratic President <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a>. In 1944, he became an early member of the conservative <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Alliance_for_the_Preservation_of_American_Ideals" title="Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals">Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals</a>, alongside <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" title="Ronald Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>, and other conservative actors and filmmakers. In February 1952, he attended a televised rally in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" title="New York">New York</a> where he enthusiastically urged General <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> to run for President. This was when Eisenhower was still being sought by both parties as their candidate. Despite having suffered a severe <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_thrombosis" title="Coronary thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a>, Gable still managed to vote by post in the 1960 presidential election. It is believed that he probably voted for the Republican candidate, and Eisenhower's vice-president, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" title="Richard Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable had a daughter, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Lewis" title="Judy Lewis">Judy Lewis</a>, the result of an affair with actress <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young" title="Loretta Young">Loretta Young</a> that began on the set of <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Call_of_the_Wild_(1935_film)" title="The Call of the Wild (1935 film)">The Call of the Wild</a></i> in 1934. In an elaborate scheme, Young took an extended vacation and went to <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a> to hide the fact that she was pregnant. After a few months, she came back to California and gave birth to their child in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice,_California" title="Venice, California">Venice</a>. Nineteen months after the birth, Loretta claimed to have adopted Judy. This ploy became less believable when the child grew up to look like her mother and Clark Gable. Judy had Gable's big ears that stuck out, as well as his eyes and smile.</p>
	<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to Lewis, Gable visited her home once, but he didn't tell her that he was her father. Neither Gable nor Young would ever publicly acknowledge their daughter's real parentage, but this fact was so widely known that, in Lewis' autobiography <i>Uncommon Knowledge</i>, she wrote that she was shocked to learn of it from other children at school. Loretta Young never officially acknowledged the fact, which she said would be the same as admitting to a "venial sin." However, she finally gave her biographer permission to include it only on the condition that the book not be published until after her death.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Gable died in <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California" title="Los Angeles, California">Los Angeles</a>, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" title="California">California</a> on November 16, 1960, the result of a <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronary_thrombosis" title="Coronary thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> ten days after suffering a severe <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. There was much speculation that Gable's physically demanding role in <i>The Misfits</i> contributed to his sudden death soon after filming was completed. In an interview with <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louella_Parsons" title="Louella Parsons">Louella Parsons</a>, published soon after Gable's death, Kay Gable was quoted as saying "It wasn't the physical exertion that killed him. It was the horrible tension, the eternal waiting, waiting, waiting. He waited around forever, for everybody. He'd get so angry that he'd just go ahead and do anything to keep occupied." Monroe said that she and Kay had become close during the filming and would refer to Clark as "Our Man", while Arthur Miller, observing Gable on location, noted that "no hint of affront ever showed on his face."</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Others have blamed Gable's <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_diet" title="Crash diet">crash diet</a> before filming began. The 6'1" (185Â cm) Gable weighed about 190Â pounds (86.2 kg) at the time of <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, but by his late 50s, he weighed 230Â pounds (104.3 kg). To get in shape for <i>The Misfits</i>, he dropped to 195Â lbs (88Â kg). In addition, Gable was in poor health from years of heavy smoking (three packs of unfiltered cigarettes a day over thirty years, as well as cigars and at least two bowlfuls of pipe tobacco a day). Until the late 1950s he had been a heavy drinker. His preferred drink was whiskey.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Filming began in a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert were dissatisfied with the quality of the script. However, they established a friendly working relationship and found that the script was no worse than those of many of their earlier films. Capra understood that they were unwilling participants and tried to lighten the mood by having Gable play practical jokes on Colbert, who responded with good humor.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both Gable and Capra enjoyed making the movie. Colbert however continued to show her displeasure on the set. She also initially balked at pulling up her skirt to entice a passing driver to provide a ride, complaining that it was unladylike. However, upon seeing the chorus girl who was brought in as her <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_double" title="Body double">body double</a>, an outraged Colbert told the director, "Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!" Through the filming, Capra claimed, Colbert made "many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me," however "she was wonderful in the part." After her acceptance speech at the Oscars ceremony, she went back on stage and thanked Capra for making the film.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sensibilities of the time played a role in some of the key scenes. Riskin specifically wrote scenes where throughout the film, Peter hangs a blanket over a rope between their beds for Ellie to have some privacy, calling it "the Walls of <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Jericho" title="Battle of Jericho">Jericho</a>". The end of the film has a telegram from Peter who has run off with Ellie as they both await news of the annulment with Westley, in part, it says, "the walls of Jericho are starting to topple". The final scene depicts an <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motel" title="Motel">auto court</a> and the couple who manage it discussing how they wonder if the two people they have just rented a room to are really married, because the young man asked for a rope, a blanket and a trumpet. The husband tells his wife he knows they are married because he saw the license. The scene closes with a trumpet sounding, the "Walls of Jericho" falling and the lights going off in the room in which Peter and Ellie are staying. Due to the strictures of the time, the device was the only plausible one that would be acceptable to a "general" audience.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Neither Gable nor Colbert were the first choices to play the lead roles. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Hopkins" title="Miriam Hopkins">Miriam Hopkins</a> first famously rejected the part of Ellie. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Montgomery_(actor)" title="Robert Montgomery (actor)">Robert Montgomery</a> and <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrna_Loy" title="Myrna Loy">Myrna Loy</a> were then offered the roles, but each turned the script down, though Loy later noted that the final story as filmed bore little resemblance to the script that she and Montgomery and been offered for their perusal. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Sullavan" title="Margaret Sullavan">Margaret Sullavan</a> also rejected the part. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constance_Bennett" title="Constance Bennett">Constance Bennett</a> was willing to play the role if she could produce the film herself; however, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> would not allow this.

In addition, <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loretta_Young" title="Loretta Young">Loretta Young</a> also turned it down.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> suggested Colbert as an actress, and she initially turned the role down. Colbert's first film, <i><a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_Love_of_Mike" title="For the Love of Mike">For the Love of Mike</a></i> (1927), had been directed by Frank Capra, and it was such a disaster that she vowed to never make another with him. Later on, she agreed to appear in <i>It Happened One Night</i> only if her salary had been doubled to $50,000, and also on the condition that the filming of her role be completed in four weeks so that she could take her well-planned vacation. According to some old tales, Gable was lent to Columbia Pictures as an actor, and it was then considered to be a minor studio, as some kind of "punishment" for refusing to take a role at his own studio. However, this tale has been refuted by more recent biographies. The <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> company did not have a movie project ready to commence for Gable, and the studio was paying him his contracted salary of $2,000 per week whether he worked or not. <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_B._Mayer" title="Louis B. Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> lent him to Columbia Pictures for $2500 per week, hence netting M.G.M. a $500 per week while he was gone.</p>

      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After filming was completed, Colbert complained to her friend, "I just finished the worst picture in the world." Capra fretted that the film was released to indifferent reviews and initially only did so-so business. Then, after it was released to the secondary movie houses, word-of-mouth began to spread and tickets sales became brisk. It turned out to be a major hit, easily Columbia's biggest hit to date.</p>
      <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In 1935, after her Academy Award nomination, Colbert decided not to attend the presentation, feeling confident that she would not win the award, and instead, planned to take a cross-country <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad" title="Railroad">railroad</a> trip. After she was named the winner, studio chief <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Cohn" title="Harry Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> sent someone to "drag her off" the train, which had not yet left the station, and take her to the ceremony.
